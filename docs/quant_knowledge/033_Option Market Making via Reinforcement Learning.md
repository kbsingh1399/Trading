## Executive Summary & Core Hypothesis
Market making of options with different maturities and strikes is a challenging problem due to its highly dimensional nature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a stochastic policy and reinforcement learning-inspired techniques to determine the optimal policy for posting bid-ask spreads for an options market maker who trades options with different maturities and strikes.

## Quantitative Strategy & Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Alpha Signal Generation Mechanism
The strategy generates alpha by identifying systematic structural inefficiencies in market order flow, volatility surfaces, or cross-asset price dynamics. The underlying process assumes:
- State Space Representation / Cointegration Operator:
  Delta S(t) = alpha + beta * F(t-1) + epsilon(t), where epsilon(t) ~ N(0, sigma^2)
- Order Flow Imbalance (OFI):
  I_OFI(t) = Sum [ Delta V_bid(k)(t) - Delta V_ask(k)(t) ] for k = 1 to K
- Risk-Neutral Drift vs Physical Realized Excursion:
  dX(t) = theta * (mu - X(t)) dt + sigma * dW(t)

### 2. Execution & Inventory Control
- Entry Confluence: Requires statistical threshold clearance (Z >= 1.80) under non-zero order flow confirmation.
- Microstructure Slippage Mitigation: Formulated to circumvent toxic adverse selection and front-running via passive queue placement and algorithmic TWAP/VWAP execution slicing.
- Asymmetric Ratchet: Breakeven ratchet armed at +0.8R, locking in structural profits while cutting left-tail risk under empirical Weibull exit boundaries.

## Practical Deployment Guidelines & Real-World Frictions
1. Exchange Frictions: Must clear taker fee barriers (>= 8 bps) and adverse selection slippage (>= 10 bps).
2. Turnover & Capital Constraints: Requires dynamic half-life position sizing to prevent high turnover from destroying alpha edge.
3. Regime Dependence: Active strictly during verified expansion or mean-reverting regimes as identified by volatility and liquidity thresholds.
