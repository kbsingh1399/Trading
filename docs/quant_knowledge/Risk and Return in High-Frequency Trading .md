Risk and Return in High-Frequency Trading
Matthew Baron, Jonathan Brogaard, Björn Hagströmer and Andrei Kirilenko*
Abstract
We study performance and competition among high-frequency traders (HFTs). We construct
measures of latency and find that differences in relative latency account for large differences in
HFTs’ trading performance. HFTs that improve their latency rank due to colocation upgrades
see improved trading performance. The stronger performance associated with speed comes
through both the short-lived information channel and the risk management channel, and speed is
useful for a variety of strategies including market making and cross-market arbitrage. We
explore implications resulting from competition on relative latency and find support for various
theoretical predictions.

Traditional models of market making argue that competition among market
intermediaries should decrease their profits and lead to lower trading costs for other investors
(Ho and Stoll, 1983; Weston 2000). Several models of high-frequency trading (HFT) adopt this
standard view.1 Other theories offer a contrasting perspective, that competition based on relative
(i.e., rank-order) latency makes the HFT industry different and leads to a distinct competitive
environment. For example, Foucault, Kozhan and Tham (2015) and Foucault, Hombert and Roşu
(2016) show how competition based on relative latency can reduce market quality by increasing
adverse selection of non-HFT firms. Biais, Foucault and Moinas (2015) and Budish, Cramton
and Shim. (2015) show in theory how it can lead to market concentration and inefficient over-
investment in speed. In these models, the fastest HFT firm responds first to profitable trading
opportunities, capturing all the gains, while slower participants arrive marginally too late to
trading opportunities to compete. As a result, small differences in trading speed are associated
with large differences in trading revenues across firms. HFT revenues do not fall over time:
regardless of how fast the market as a whole becomes, there is always at least one HFT firm with
a relative speed advantage that can adversely select other traders.
Motivated by the view that competition based on relative latency differs from
competition of traditional market intermediaries, this paper tests whether relative latency can
explain cross-sectional differences in HFT performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to
present direct evidence that small differences in trading speed are associated with large
differences in trading revenues.
While HFTs benefit from the use of microwave transmission technologies (Shkilko and
Sokolov, 2016) and colocation services (Brogaard, Hagströmer, Nordén and Riordan, 2015), it is

unclear to what extent speed matters for trading performance and through which channels. For
example, Brogaard et al. (2015) finds that not all HFTs choose faster colocation technology
when offered, and we similarly find only about half of HFTs react to market events at time scales
near the latency frontier. This suggests that many HFTs use computational power for other
reasons, perhaps to better aggregate information from news feeds or order flow, and may not
compete to be fastest. Despite these alternative possibilities, we find that the HFTs who are the
fastest have better trading performance. We also find evidence supporting the importance of
relative latency for trading performance and explore some of the predictions regarding market
concentration.
The theoretical literature has put forward a variety of channels through which HFTs may
translate speed into profitability. For example, HFTs can use speed to enhance risk management,
by avoiding adverse selection (Jovanovic and Menkveld, 2015) and improving inventory
management (Aït-Sahalia and Saglam, 2014), or to trade on short-lived information (Foucault et
al., 2016). We find evidence that firms with lower relative latency are better along both of these
dimensions. The fastest firms earn a higher realized spread when trading passively, consistent
with better risk management. They also have the highest price impact when trading with market
orders, suggesting they are able to be the first to react to new information. Looking at cross-
market arbitrage, we also observe the fastest firms being more responsive to information on other
exchanges. Thus, there is no one single dimension through which speed is beneficial.
Our analysis uses proprietary transaction-level data with trader identifiers provided by the
Swedish financial supervisory authority, Finansinspektionen. The data contain all trades of
Swedish equities from January 2010 to December 2014 from all venues including regulated
exchanges, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), and dark pools. Given the high degree of
fragmentation of volume in European equity trading, this cross-market coverage is an important
2

feature to get the whole picture of trading. In addition, the five-year length of our data is
important in allowing us to trace the “long-term” evolution of the HFT industry, at least relative
to the rapid pace of innovation in the industry.
We focus on the 25 largest Swedish stocks by market capitalization, as Hagströmer and
Nordén (2013) show that HFT activity is mainly concentrated in these stocks. We classify high-
frequency traders as those firms that self-describe as such through their membership in the
European Principal Traders Association (FIA-EPTA; a lobby organization for principal trading
firms formed in June 2011) and any other firm that, according to its own website, undertakes
low-latency proprietary trading.2 The 16 firms that we identify as HFTs all have international
trading operations and none of them are headquartered in Sweden. Thus, it is unlikely that the
findings reported in this paper are specific to the Swedish context.3
We test the connection between HFT latency and trading performance. The main trading
performance measure is Revenues, captured daily for each HFT firm as the net of purchases and
sales, marking end-of-day positions to market.4 We also include risk-adjusted performance
measures, including returns, factor model alphas, and Sharpe ratios. We find that HFTs exhibit
large, persistent cross-sectional differences in performance, with trading revenues
2 As a robustness check, we alternatively use observed trading behavior to classify firms as HFTs (e.g., if a firm has
median daily trading volume > 25 million SEK and median end-of-day inventory as a percent of firm trading
volume < 30%). The alternative specification addresses the possibility that some firms may not advertise themselves
as HFTs. Classification based on observed trading behavior produces nearly the exact same list of HFTs as our main
approach based on self-reporting.
3 The data availability of the Swedish equity market has made it one of the most analyzed markets in the HFT
literature. Hagströmer and Nordén (2013) show that HFTs are highly active in this market, constituting around 30%
of the trading volume and more than 80% of the order volume. Other empirical studies on this market are
Breckenfelder (2013); Brogaard et al. (2015); Hagströmer, Nordén and Zhang (2014); van Kervel and Menkveld
(2015); and Menkveld and Zoican (2015).
4 Since our data set does not convey trading fees or other HFT operational costs, we are unable to directly calculate
trading profits. However, in Section III, we analyze regulatory filings of five major HFT firms (Virtu, 2011-2015;
Knight Capital Group, 2013-2015; GETCO, 2009-2012; Flow Traders, 2012-2015; and Jump Trading, 2010), which
allow comparison of trading revenues and profits. We do not find evidence suggesting that higher trading revenues
are associated with higher technological or operational costs and conclude that HFT revenue variation is a good
proxy for variation in HFT profits.

disproportionally accumulating to a few firms. The results are robust to accounting for estimated
exchange fees and liquidity rebates, which negligibly change the results.
Our main measure of latency is the difference in time stamps from a passive trade to a
subsequent aggressive trade by the same firm, in the same stock and at the same trading venue.
This measure, which we call Decision Latency, aims to capture the reaction time involved in a
deliberate decision to trade in reaction to a market event (its limit order being hit), which the
HFT firm may view as informative. Specifically, for each HFT firm, we record the empirical
latency distribution of all events where a passive trade is followed by an active trade by the same
HFT firm in the same stock and at the same venue within one second. To capture the fastest
possible reaction time for each HFT firm while also being robust to potential outliers, we use the
0.1% quantile of that distribution as the latency for each HFT firm.5 As an example of a strategy
our measure may capture, Clark-Joseph (2012) shows that HFTs use the execution of small test
orders as a signal to trade on incoming order flow ahead of public order book feeds. Over our
five-year sample period we show that the latency of the fastest HFTs falls substantially.
We find that relative latency, not nominal latency, drives differences in performance
across HFTs. Relative latency measures how fast a HFT firm is relative to other HFTs and is
captured by ranking HFTs by their calculated latency measure. Nominal latency measures how
fast a HFT firm is in absolute terms and is captured by the log of a HFT firm’s calculated
Decision Latency. Our evidence is consistent with Biais et al. (2015) and Budish et al. (2015),
who argue that competition on relative latency can lead to an inefficient and costly arms race.
The discontinuous difference in payoffs provides strong incentives to become marginally faster
than other HFTs through greater technological investment. Such competition on relative latency
5 The results are robust to using alternative quantile thresholds (0.5% and 1%) and Mean Latency, which is
computed as the mean of this distribution conditional on being less than 1 millisecond. See Section IV.C.

gives rise to a “positional externality” (Frank, 2005), since a firm that becomes faster increases
the relative latency of its competitors, which can in turn lead to an inefficient over-investment in
speed.
We find that firms that are among the five fastest HFTs, and in particular the fastest
single HFT firm, earn substantially higher revenues than other HFTs. It is not being fast that
allows an HFT firm to capture trading opportunities, it is being faster than others, consistent with
Biais et al. (2015) and Budish et al. (2015). Furthermore, we find that the fastest HFTs capture
more trading opportunities and have higher risk-adjusted revenues, but they do not earn higher
revenue margins per SEK traded. The differential finding suggests that on a per-trade basis, the
fastest HFTs are no more accurate than other traders at processing and analyzing information
(trade quality), but their latency advantage allows them to capture more trading opportunities
(trade quantity) without taking on higher risk.6
As a robustness check, we construct various alternative approaches to measuring HFT
latency. For example, Queuing Latency, captures the race to be at the top of the order book, as
motivated, for example, by theoretical work by Yueshen (2014) and empirical findings by Yao
and Ye (2015). Specifically, following price changes that lead to an empty price level in the limit
order book, we count how often a given HFT firm submits the first limit order and thus gets to
the top of the queue. Importantly, Queuing Latency does not rely on time stamps, making it
robust to potential time stamp noise, and it is potentially better at capturing latency of HFTs that
do not use market orders. Nevertheless, we find qualitatively similar results as with our primary
latency measure.
6 We use aggregate revenues as the main measure of performance to capture trade quantity. If strategies are not
easily scalable, trade quality measures such as per-trade revenues are less relevant for comparing firms (Chen, Hong,
Huang, and Kubik, 2004). A firm that has high revenues per trade but that captures few trading opportunities may
not be considered a strong performer.

To address possible endogeneity concerns, we present causal evidence from a quasi-
experimental setting, studying two colocation upgrades on the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
exchange: the “Premium Colocation” upgrade first offered on March 14, 2011 and the “10G
Colocation” upgrade first offered on September 17, 2012. These colocation upgrades lead some,
but not all, HFTs to get faster.7 We compare the change in trading performance for HFTs that
become relatively faster to those that become relatively slower. We show, as before, that
increases in relative speed lead to better trading performance.
We then investigate through which channels relative latency benefits traders. Some
theories view fast traders as using speed to trade on short-lived information, whether in reaction
to news, order flow, or latency arbitrage (Cartea and Penalva 2012; Foucault et al., 2015;
Foucault et al., 2016; Biais et al., 2015; and Roşu 2015). Other theories view speed as a way to
avoid adverse selection and inventory costs (Jovanovic and Menkveld, 2015; Aït-Sahalia and
Saglam, 2014; Hoffmann, 2014). Menkveld and Zoican (2015) posit that both these types can co-
exist in equilibrium.
We examine the role of relative latency in both channels, both in the general setting as
well as in a specific cross-market strategy. We proxy the short-lived information channel by the
ability of a market order to predict price changes over the next 10 seconds, and the risk
management channel by the ability of a passive order to capture a large realized spread. Relative
latency is associated with better performance through both channels. As a specific strategy, we
study cross-market arbitrage by examining HFTs’ equity trading following changes in the price
of index futures. In the second after a change in the index futures price, the fastest HFTs are
more likely than other HFTs to aggressively trade in individual equities in the direction of the
7 This differential effect on HFTs may be explained by the fact that not all HFTs immediately subscribe to the
colocation upgrade, as documented by Brogaard et al., 2015; and even that among those that do, not all HFTs may
be equally able to translate this technology into faster trading.

futures price change. The fastest HFTs are also less likely to supply liquidity to equities trades in
the direction of the futures price change, which is consistent with avoiding adverse selection. We
thus conclude that relative latency is important for performance both in short-lived information
trading and in risk management.
Finally, we explore predictions regarding the effects of relative latency on market
concentration. If the traditional view of market-making competition holds (Ho and Stoll, 1983;
Weston 2000), we expect the alpha generated by HFTs and the concentration of revenues to
disappear as the industry matures. Alternatively, if HFTs compete on relative latency, we do not
expect increased competition to drive profit opportunities to zero. As argued by Budish et al.
(2015), regardless of how fast the market as a whole becomes, there is always at least one firm
with a relative speed advantage that can adversely select other traders. Additionally, rents remain
concentrated among the fastest HFTs, as slower HFTs arrive marginally too late to trading
opportunities to compete.
Consistent with the predictions of the effects of competition on relative latency, we find
that the HFT industry is concentrated among a few firms. In contrast to the traditional view that
increased competition over time leads to lower profits, HFT concentration of trading revenues
and trading volumes are high and non-declining over the five year sample, despite new HFT firm
entry and a decline in overall HFT latency. We furthermore find that new HFT entrants are
typically slower, earn lower trading revenues, and are more likely to exit, which likely reinforces
concentration in the HFT industry.8
8 A previous version of this paper analyzes HFT performance in the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract over a two
year period from 2010 to 2012. While the E-mini is completely consolidated on one trading venue and has a
relatively high relative tick size, Swedish equities trading is fragmented across multiple venues, and features smaller
relative tick sizes and lower trading volumes. Nevertheless, we generate similar findings (e.g., high industry
concentration, difficulty of new entry, and the importance of latency), suggesting that the findings of this paper are
replicable, have external validity, and are robust to differences in market structure.

II. Data and Methodology
A. Data
Our primary data source is the Transaction Reporting System (TRS), a proprietary data set
provided to us by Finansinspektionen, the Swedish financial supervisory authority. According to
the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), financial institutions in the European
Union that are under the supervision of one of the national financial supervisory authorities must
report all their transactions with financial instruments to TRS.
The TRS data has two features that make it highly suitable for the analysis of revenues in
equity trading. First, the scope of the reporting obligation spans transaction at all trading venues,
including regulated exchanges, MTFs, and dark pools. This is important given the high degree of
fragmentation of volume in European equity trading. Second, TRS contains identifiers (name,
business identifier code, and address) for both the trading entity reporting the transaction and its
counterparty. If the reporting entity undertakes the transaction as a broker for another financial
institution, the identifiers for the client institution are reported too. The trader identifiers are
necessary to identify HFTs and to analyze revenues in the cross-section of firms. Finally, the
TRS data contains standard transaction-level variables such as date, time, venue, price, currency,
quantity, and a buy/sell indicator. See Appendix Section A1 for information about the filtering
procedures applied to the TRS data.9
We restrict the sample to the constituents of the leading Swedish equity index, the OMX
S30 in order to focus on the most liquid stocks where HFTs primarily operate (Hagströmer and
Nordén, 2013). We exclude six stocks that are cross-listed in other currencies, because revenue
9 A limitation of the data set is that we cannot track activities in related securities, such as options and futures. To
mitigate the effects this may have on inventory and revenue measurement, we exclude trades that are flagged in the
data as derivative-related.

calculations for such stocks would require transaction data for foreign exchange markets.10 There
is one index constituent change during the sample period. We include Kinnevik Investment AB
(KINVb) after its inclusion in the index on July 1, 2014, and we include Scania AB (SCVb) up
until May 16, 2014, when it ceased trading. The final sample has 25 stocks covering the period
January 4, 2010 to December 30, 2014.
We match the TRS transactions to transaction-level data available from the Thomson
Reuters Tick History (TRTH) database. The TRTH database is accessed through the Securities
Research Centre of Asia-Pacific (SIRCA). The purpose of the matching is twofold. First,
whereas the TRS data has second-by-second time stamps, TRTH has time stamps at a
microsecond granularity. Through the matching we can assign microsecond time stamps to the
TRS data, which is important for our latency measurement. Second, TRTH also contains order
book information recorded on a microsecond frequency synchronized to the transaction data.
This enables us to assess the status of the order book just before each TRS transaction, which is
necessary to measure, for instance, the effective spread and to determine whether the trade was
initiated by the buyer or the seller, following Lee and Ready (1991).11
B. Trading Venues and Stock Characteristics
All the sample stocks have their primary listing at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, which is
open for continuous electronic limit order book trading from 9:00 am to 5:25 pm on weekdays.
10 The six stocks are ABB Ltd, Nokia Corporation, TeliaSonera AB, Nordéa Bank AB, AstraZeneca PLC, and LM
Ericsson B.
11 Concerns about the accuracy of the Lee-Ready algorithm (see Ellis, Michaely and O’Hara, 2000) have limited
applicability in this data set. First, trades inside the quotes are uncommon. This is due to that the volume of hidden
orders must exceed 50,000 euros, making such orders rare. There is a midpoint trading facility at NASDAQ OMX
Stockholm, but its volume share is less than 0.1%. Second, misclassification due to fast trading is unlikely. For each
trade recorded in TRTH, there is also a quote update (usually with the same microsecond time stamp) reflecting how
the trade influences the order book.
9

For details about the trading mechanism at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, see Hagströmer and
Nordén (2013). Other important trading venues by trading volume in our data are Chi-X, BATS,
Turquoise (all based around London) and Burgundy (based in Stockholm). In February 2011,
BATS and Chi-X merged at the corporate level, but they maintain separate trading venues
throughout our sample period. Burgundy was acquired by Oslo Börs in 2012. All sample stocks
are subject to mandatory central counterparty clearing.
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the sample stocks. Market Capitalization at
closing prices on December 31, 2014 ranges from 13,877 million SEK (henceforth MSEK) for
SSABa to 475,595 MSEK for HMb, the equivalent of 1.78 to 60.91 billion USD, converted at the
exchange rate of December 31, 2014. In the U.S. equities market, these stocks would be labeled
as large or mid-cap stocks.
INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE
Daily Trading Volume refers to trading at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm only and is
reported in MSEK. Daily Turnover is the Daily Trading Volume divided by Market
Capitalization, expressed in percentage points. Tick Size is the average minimum price change.
Quoted Spread is the average bid-ask spread prevailing just before each trade; and Effective
Spread is the trade value-weighted average absolute difference between the trade price and the
bid-ask midpoint. All spread measures are based on continuous trading at NASDAQ OMX
Stockholm, expressed relative to the bid-ask spread midpoint, and presented in basis points. The
Tick Size and the Quoted Spread are halved to be comparable to the Effective Spread. The Daily
Turnover across stocks is 0.60% and the Quoted Spread and Effective Spread vary between 2 and
6 bps. The more liquid stocks in our sample have a turnover and spread similar to the US large-
cap stocks studied by Brogaard, Hendershott, and Riordan (2014). The Tick Size for many stocks
10

is close to the Quoted Spread, indicating that market tightness is frequently bounded by the tick
size.
Finally, we report Volatility, the average 10-second squared basis point returns,
calculated from bid-ask midpoints; and an index for the degree of volume fragmentation. The
Fragmentation Index is defined as the inverse of a Herfindahl index of trading volumes across
the five largest trading venues (BATS, Burgundy, Chi-X, NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, and
Turquoise). The procedure implies that fragmentation is measured on a scale from one to the
number of trading venues considered, which in our case is five.12 Volatility ranges from 3 to 17
squared basis points, and the Fragmentation Index varies across stocks between 1.76 and 2.32.
C. HFT Identification
Previous studies classify HFTs according to observed trading behavior (as in Kirilenko,
Kyle, Samadi and Tuzun, 2015) or using an exchange-defined classification (Brogaard et al.,
2014). We define HFTs as those who self-describe as HFTs by including firms that are members
of the FIA-EPTA or that according to their own website primarily undertake low-latency
proprietary trading. The advantage of this approach over a classification based on observed
trading behavior is that we can verify that HFTs have the characteristics usually associated with
them: high trading volume, short investment horizons, and tight inventory management
(Securities and Exchange Commission, 2010).
To include an HFT firm, we also require it to trade at least 10 MSEK a day, about 1.05
million USD at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014, for at least 50 trading days of the 1,255
trading days in the sample. We find 25 firms who self-describe as HFTs, 16 of which satisfy the
12 If there are N trading venues and they all have equal shares of the trading volume, the index takes its maximum
value N. If all trading volume is concentrated to one venue the index takes its minimum value, which is 1. The index
design is similar to the Fidessa Fragmentation Index, more details of which can be found at
http://fragmentation.fidessa.com/faq/#faq2
11

volume criteria and form our sample of HFTs. The firm-day requirement of 10 MSEK is
imposed to avoid outliers in trading performance that can appear due to small volumes. The nine
firms that self-describe as HFTs, but that do not satisfy the volume criteria together represent
only 0.13% of the total HFT trading volume, and 0.85% of the firm-day observations.13
D. HFT Performance Measures
We study three dimensions of performance: quantity measures, risk-adjusted measures,
and quality measures. The quantity performance dimension measures the ability to capture
trading opportunities that are ex-ante expected to be profitable to the HFT firm, such as short-
lived arbitrage events and the supply of liquidity to uninformed investors. The risk-adjusted
performance dimension measures the ability to capture revenue while avoiding risky trades. The
quality performance dimension measures the ability to capture revenues relative to trading
volume.
We capture quantity performance using Revenues and Trading Volume. Revenues is
defined as the cumulative cash received from selling shares, minus the cash paid from buying
shares, plus the value of any outstanding end-of-day inventory positions marked to the market
price at close. We calculate Revenues for each HFT firm, each sample stock, and each trading
day. Depending on the application we report Revenues for different frequencies of time, for
individual HFT firms as well as across all firms in the industry, and for individual stocks or all
stocks; however, all versions of Revenues are aggregates of the same panel of firm-stock-day
13 Due to confidentiality requirements, we cannot report the full list of names of the 25 HFTs covered in the
proprietary data set. However, in Appendix Section A2, we use public trading records to report the names of 19
HFTs who trade at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm as members. The HFTs not listed in Appendix Section A2 therefore
trade only at other trading venues or as clients of other members at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm.
12

observations. Trading Volume is the SEK volume traded, measured at the same frequency as
Revenues.
We assume zero beginning-of-day inventory positions as a way to overcome potential
data errors. Even minor errors in inventory can accumulate over time, leading to large and
persistent (unit root) errors if left uncorrected. Therefore, we zero beginning-of-day inventories
so that any potential errors do not affect more than one day. This assumption is relatively
innocuous because we show below that most HFTs usually end the day near a zero position
anyway (see Table 2). In the Appendix Section A3, we compare our main method of calculating
trading revenues with three alternative approaches, one of which relaxes the assumption of zero
inventory at the start of the trading day and cumulates daily net inventory positions over the full
sample. We conclude that alternative definitions of Revenues yield similar results.
To capture risk-adjusted performance we measure Returns, factor model Alphas (one,
three, or four factors), and the Sharpe Ratio. Through the use of risk-adjusted performance
measures, we assess whether HFTs with higher revenues are simply taking on more risk. The
view that fast traders can achieve high risk-adjusted performance is supported by both theoretical
models and real-world evidence. Ait-Sahalia and Saglam (2014) show that fast market-makers
are better at handle inventory risk, and Hoffman (2014) shows that fast traders are able to avoid
adverse selection risk. In its IPO prospectus, Virtu, an HFT firm in our sample, states: “we had
only one losing trading day during … a total of 1,238 trading days.” 14
Returns are calculated by dividing Revenues of each firm by the implied capitalization of
the firm. The implied capitalization is calculated for each HFT firm as the maximum position in
SEK that a firm’s portfolio takes over the five-year sample. HFTs’ inventories generally exhibit

13

sharp, well-defined maximum and minimum total portfolio positions. We use the observed
maximum position as an approximation of the maximum amount of capital that an HFT firm
would need to execute its specific strategy in Swedish equities markets.15 Returns can thus be
viewed as the performance achieved relative the capital allocated to the trading operation.
Returns are calculated at daily frequencies but throughout the paper are reported annualized.
Factor model Alphas are computed for each HFT firm over the entire sample using the
standard Fama-French model (Fama and French, 1993) and the Carhart (1997) momentum
factor. The Fama-French and Carhart daily factors are constructed for Swedish equities
according to the methodology from Fama and French (1993) and Ken French’s website, using
the full sample of Swedish stocks traded on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. Methodological details
concerning the construction of these factors and validation exercises can be found in the
Appendix Section A4.
The annualized Sharpe Ratio for each HFT firm is calculated using daily observations as
𝜇 −𝑟
𝑖 𝑓∗√252, where µ is the average daily return, r is the risk-free rate, and σ is the standard
i f i
𝜎
𝑖
deviation of HFT firm i’s returns. Whereas Returns and factor model Alphas rely on the
assumption that market capitalization can be proxied by the maximum inventory position of the
trading firm, the Sharpe Ratio does not. To see this, note that if the risk-free rate can be
neglected as it is nearly zero for much of the sample period, the Sharpe Ratio is equivalent to:
𝜇(𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠)
𝑖 ∗√252. The equity capitalization is therefore irrelevant for calculating the Sharpe
𝜎(𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠)
𝑖
Ratio.
15 In Section III, we show that HFT returns calculated this way are comparable in magnitude to those from
regulatory filings of five major HFT firms (Virtu, 2011-2015; Knight Capital Group, 2013-2015; GETCO, 2009-
2012; Flow Traders, 2012-2015, and Jump Trading, 2010), where one can directly observe book capitalization or net
liquid assets available to trade.

We capture quality performance with the Revenues per MSEK Traded measure. The
quality dimension of performance measures the ability to enter trades with a high revenue
margin. Revenues per MSEK Traded is calculated daily as Revenues divided by Trading Volume.
The performance measures do not account for trading fees and liquidity rebates. We show
in Section III.C that an adjustment for estimated exchange fees and liquidity rebates does not
change the conclusions of the paper.
E. HFT Latency
Generally, latency is the delay between a signal and a response, measured in units of
time. Following Weller (2013), we define the signal as a passive execution for the HFT firm in
question, and the response as a subsequent aggressive execution by the same firm. Examples of
why HFTs would attempt to trade aggressively immediately after a passive execution include test
orders described by Clark-Joseph (2012) and “scratch” trades described by Kirilenko et al.
(2015). The HFT firm cannot control the timing of the passive trade but can only react to it. Our
latency measure thus captures reactions to incoming order flow, not how fast an HFT firm can
execute two successive trades.
Specifically, for each firm in each month, we record all cases where a passive trade is
followed by an aggressive trade by the same firm, in the same stock and at the same trading
venue, within one second. The time-stamp difference between the two trades in each case forms
an empirical distribution of response times. To capture the fastest possible reaction time, while
also being robust to potential outliers, we define Decision Latency as the 0.1% quantile of the
aforementioned distribution. 16, 17
16 To ensure that Decision Latency is not picking up trades that happen close to each other by chance (or by time
stamp error that can also make time stamps randomly happen close to each other by chance), we simulate the
15

Decision Latency captures the following sequence of events. The starting point is when
an HFT firm’s resting limit order is executed by an incoming market order. The matching engine
processes and time stamps the trade. A confirmation message is then sent to the HFT firm. The
firm processes the confirmation information and makes a decision on how to react, which may be
in the form of an aggressive order. The end of the latency measure is marked by the time stamp
assigned when the message for the market order is processed by the matching engine.
By excluding cases where the two trades are recorded at different trading venues we
avoid potential problems related to that time-stamps are not perfectly synchronized across
venues. Additionally, we can test whether within-market Decision Latency also explains success
at arbitrage across markets (see Section V).
There are numerous signals that may trigger HFTs to react swiftly, including news
events, order book gaps, and block orders. The inherent problem of signal-to-response latency
measures is that HFTs employ different strategies and put different weights to different signals.
We argue that it is likely that HFTs respond to signals affecting their own portfolio such as a
passive execution. Our measure of Decision Latency, while not perfect, captures an important
dimension of latency that varies across market participants. While we conjecture that the passive
trade is the information triggering the subsequent aggressive trade, this cannot be confirmed.
probability of two successive trades – a passive trade followed by an aggressive trade – occurring by chance within a
sub-millisecond interval. We find the probability to be small. Specifically, we simulate Decision Latency under the
assumption that an HFT firm’s trades within any venue or stock are uniformly distributed across a time period [0,T];
we then construct a simulated Decision Latency by examining the 0.1% quantile of the resulting latency
observations of a passive trade followed by an aggressive trade. We make conservative assumptions: T = 666,600
trading seconds per month, and 37,431 aggressive trades and 59,162 passive trades per month, corresponding to the
maximum observed aggressive and passive trades of any HFT in any stock-venue-month. Using simulation, we find
the probability that Decision Latency is less than 50 microseconds to be less than 0.00001% for any firm-stock-
venue-month observation. Given 15,169 firm-stock-venue-month observations in which HFTs trade, the probability
is less than 1 – (1 – 0.0000001)15169 = 0.2% that even one of these 15.169 observations would be less than 50
microseconds by chance, even with these highly conservative assumptions. Thus, our empirical measurements of
Decision Latency are almost certainly not due to chance or related to trading volume.
17 The results are robust to using alternative quantile thresholds (0.5% and 1%) and Mean Latency, which is
computed as the mean of this distribution conditional on being less than 1 millisecond. See Section IV.C.
16

Also, the measure is less informative for HFTs that do not tend to follow passive executions with
immediate aggressive executions.18 However, these limitations should result in underestimating,
not exacerbating, the role of speed in performance. Furthermore, in Section IV.C we show that
our results are robust to two alternative measures of latency, Queuing Latency and Mean
Latency.
Figure 1 plots Decision Latency over the sample period 2010-2014. HFTs are grouped by
their relative rank of latency per month; the categories are Top 1, Top 1-5, and all HFTs. Over
the sample period latency decreases for HFTs in the top 5: for example, the latency of the Top 1
HFTs decreases from around 62 microseconds in 2010 to around 10 microseconds in 2014. The
relative reduction in latency is much greater for Top 1-5 HFTs, who start out in 2010 with
latencies of over 1,280 microseconds and converge in latency to the Top 1 HFT by 2014. In
contrast, All HFTs, which disproportionately picks up the slower HFTs, remains relatively
constant with an average latency of 25 milliseconds over the entire sample period. The finding
that HFTs outside the Top 5 do not achieve lower latencies over time is consistent with the
finding of Brogaard et al. (2015) that not all HFTs choose to be the fastest when given the
opportunity to choose a faster colocation technology.
INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE
The magnitude of latency recorded for the fastest HFTs in this paper is consistent with
statements about the INET trading system used at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. In marketing
18 Decision Latency cannot be measured for HFTs that trade exclusively using either aggressive or passive orders. In
our sample, 2.2% of the firm-months are subject to this limitation, but those firm-months represent only 0.0007% of
the trades. Another limitation of the Decision Latency definition is that fee differences may incentivize designated
market makers (DMMs) to behave differently from other brokers. There are however no DMMs in our sample
stocks.
17

materials from 2012, NASDAQ states that their trading system delivers “sub-40 microsecond
latency.”19 At that time, our fastest measured latency is around 60 microseconds.20
Figure 1 marks various technological upgrades: the introduction of INET in early 2010, a
high-capacity trading system capable of handling over 1 million messages per second, and two
colocation upgrades at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm in March 2011 and September 2012. The fact
that Decision Latency decreases following the technology upgrades provide suggestive evidence
that our latency measure indeed captures reaction time. While it is difficult to assess the impact
of the 2010 INET upgrade since it comes at the start of the sample, the colocation upgrade of
2012 is followed by a decline in latency for the top 5 HFTs. The fact that latency falls
subsequent to colocation upgrades is a valuable validation of our measure. In Section IV, we use
the 2011 and 2012 colocation upgrades to provide evidence on a causal relation between relative
latency and trading performance.
III. Characterizing HFT Performance
A. HFT Performance in the Cross-Section
We document the risk and return characteristics of individual HFT firms. In Table 2 we
report the cross-sectional distribution of HFT performance, latency, and other trading
characteristics. For each variable, we retrieve the time-series average for each HFT firm, and
then report the distributional statistics across firms.
INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE
19 http://www.nasdaqomx.com/digitalAssets/82/82655_markettechoverview_oct2012.pdf
20 As additional points of reference, CME Globex advertised in October 2015 median inbound latency of 52
microseconds, and the Swiss X-Stream INET exchange advertises average round-trip latencies of 33 microseconds
for their ITCH Market Data interface. The Bombay Stock Exchange claimed to operate the fastest platform in the
world with a median response speed of 6 microseconds (www.bseindia.com/static/about/milestones.aspx). It is
important to note that these are median or average numbers, whereas we consider the 0.1% quantile.
18

The median HFT firm realizes an average daily Revenues of 6,990 SEK, or 56.5 SEK
Revenues per MSEK Traded. It has a daily Trading Volume of 64 MSEK, an annualized Sharpe
Ratio of 1.61, and a four-factor (Fama-French plus Carhart momentum) annualized Alpha of 9%.
The Returns are also 9%, suggesting that exposure to well-documented risk factors is not
particularly relevant for HFT firms.21
We find considerable performance variation in the cross-section of HFTs. The cross-
sectional distributions are skewed towards a few high performers. For example, firms in the top
90th percentile generate Revenues of 61,354 SEK per day, compared with 6,990 for the median; a
Sharpe Ratio of 11.1, compared with 1.61 at the median; Revenues per MSEK Traded of 472.2,
compared with 56.5 at the median; and a four-factor annualized Alpha of 89%, compared with
9% at the median.
HFTs are diverse in terms of other trading characteristics, too. Beyond performance, we
report the distributions of End-of-Day Inventory Ratio (the end-of-day inventory divided by
Trading Volume); Max. Intraday Inventory Ratio (the maximum intraday portfolio position
divided by Trading Volume); Investment Horizon (the median holding time in seconds across all
trades, calculated on a first-in-first-out basis); Aggressiveness Ratio (the market order volume in
SEK divided by Trading Volume); and Decision Latency (in microseconds). Consistent with the
characterization of HFTs in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Concept Release on
Equity Market Structure (2010) and with functional-based approaches for HFT classification
(Kirilenko et al., 2015), most, though not all, HFTs tend to have low intraday and end-of-day
inventories. HFTs vary in their Aggressiveness Ratio, with some nearly all active or passive and
21 Appendix Section A5 analyzes HFT performance after accounting for potential maker-taker fees and liquidity
rebates. Even after accounting for the most conservative possible fees and/or rebates, trading performance for the
entire distribution is shifted down slightly, but the results are qualitatively similar. For example, the performance
results are still positively skewed, with the same HFTs at the top strongly outperforming their competitors.
19

others mixed. The average aggressive ratio is 53%. Consistent with Figure 1 and the discussion
above, there is also substantial variation in Decision Latency across HFTs, from 42 microsecond
latency at the 10th percentile to 0.5 second latency at the 90th percentile, a finding we explore in
Section IV. Notably, the 0.5 second latency for some HFTs to process information and react with
a market order is slow for automated traders but still fast relative to human reaction time.
B. Comparison of Trading Revenues to Trading Profits Based on Public Filings
The data do not convey trading fees or other operational costs and so we are unable to
directly calculate trading profits. However, regulatory filings of five major HFT firms (Virtu,
2011-2015; Knight Capital Group, 2013-2015; GETCO, 2009-2012; Flow Traders, 2012-2015;
and Jump, 2010) allow a comparison of trading revenues and trading profits. A potential concern
in our analysis of HFT performance is that firms with higher trading revenues may have higher
fixed costs. That is, firms with higher trading revenue may also incur higher costs to produce
better performance. If true, then trading revenues may not be a good proxy for firm profitability.
We show that this is not likely the case.
Table 3 reports trading revenue, trading costs, trading profit margins, and trading
returns calculated from annual reports, IPO prospectuses, and SEC disclosures for five HFT
firms for which public data is available.22 Trading costs are broken down into several categories
such as trading and clearing fees, data costs, financing costs, equipment and technical costs, all
expressed as a percent of trading revenues. Trading costs also include depreciation and
amortization. This serves as a control for investments that a firm may have undertaken in years
preceding the public data coverage.
22 Jump Trading was never a public company like the other four but nevertheless filed publicly available SEC
disclosures containing trading revenues and profits for 2010 (see, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-
07-23/don-t-tell-anybody-about-this-story-on-hft-power-jump-trading).
20

INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE
We make two observations. First, trading profit margins are high, ranging between 27.4%
and 64.5% of trading revenue for all four firms. Approximately 40-80% of the HFT costs are
per-trade fees: brokerage fees, exchange and clearance fees, and financing costs. The fixed (i.e.
not per-trade) costs, including communications and data processing, equipment, administrative
and technology costs, make up only 15-30% of the total costs. As a result, we conclude that fixed
costs, which include costs related to technological investment and colocation services, are small
relative to trading revenues, making it unlikely that firms with the highest trading revenues face
higher investments costs that would substantially reduce their net profits.
Second, as a percentage of trading revenues, the fixed costs do not vary substantially
across firms, suggesting that revenues are not correlated with fixed costs in percentage terms. For
example, in 2014, KCG had double the trading revenue of Virtu and five times the trading
revenue of Flow Traders, but the total fixed costs as a percentage of trading revenue show no
pattern (22.7% for KCG; 17.7% for Virtu; 27.2% for Flow Traders). There is also no clear time
trend in fixed costs within each firm to suggest that higher trading revenues periods might be
correlated with higher fixed costs. All else being equal, the stability of the fixed costs suggests
that firms with higher trading revenues also have higher profits. As such, HFT revenue variation
is likely a close proxy for variation in HFT profits.
Table 3 reports trading returns. Trading returns are calculated in two ways based on
different capitalization measures: trading revenue / (trading assets minus trading liabilities) and
(trading revenue / book equity). From these public filings in which capitalization is directly
observable, we find trading returns to range from 60% to almost 237%, depending on the firm.
This suggests the returns computed in Section III.A are of a reasonable magnitude.
21

IV. The Role of Speed in Performance
Having documented the performance of HFTs, we now test our main hypothesis about
speed and HFT trading revenues. While most theories in which HFTs earn profits posit that fast
traders should have an advantage, other theories suggest that traders of different speed can
specialize along other dimensions (Weller, 2013; Roşu, 2015). According to these models, a
relatively slow market intermediary could compensate by providing deeper liquidity on the book
or greater risk-bearing capacity, thus making similar profits as fast traders in equilibrium.
Alternatively, some firms can simply be more skilled than others. For example, differences in
technological capabilities can persist because technological expertise and trading strategies are
closely guarded trade secrets, giving rise to barriers preventing the movement of human capital
and technical knowledge across firms.
A. The Relation between Trading Performance and Latency
Motivated by the contrasting theories discussed in the introduction, we test whether
latency, and especially relative latency, is associated with increased performance.
We estimate the following regression model using ordinary least squares (OLS):
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 𝛼 +𝛽 log(𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦) + 𝛽 𝟏 +𝛽 𝟏
𝑖,𝑡 𝑡 1 𝑖,𝑡 2 top 1 𝑖,𝑡 3 top 1-5 𝑖,𝑡
+𝛾′𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠 + month-FEs+ 𝜖 , (1)
𝑖,𝑡 𝑖,𝑡
where 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 is one of the HFT performance measures Revenues, Returns, Sharpe
𝑖,𝑡
Ratio, Revenues per MSEK Traded, or Trading Volume. All dependent variables are aggregated
across stocks, venues, and days within the month to generate a firm-month panel on which Eqn.
(1) is estimated. Specifically, Revenues and Trading Volume are averaged across trading days,
and Returns and Revenues per MSEK Traded are calculated using the firm-month observations
22

of Revenues and Trading Volume. The factor model Alphas are not included because they are
nearly identical to Returns, as discussed in Section III.A.
The independent variables 𝟏 and 𝟏 , are indicators for whether a given firm
top 1 𝑖,𝑡 top 1-5 𝑖,𝑡
is ranked in the Top 1 or Top 1-5 by speed in a given month. Nominal latency is captured using
Decision Latency, while the 𝟏 and 𝟏 indicators capture relative speed. Since
top 1 𝑖,𝑡 top 1-5 𝑖,𝑡
Decision Latency can vary widely across firms, from the microsecond to the second level (see
Table 2), the relationship between trading speed and trading revenues is best captured by taking
logs. The indicator variables capture the potentially non-linear relationship between latency and
performance: the fastest firms may perform substantially better than firms that are only slightly
slower.
The control variables account for other characteristics that may affect HFT performance,
including measures of their risk-bearing capacity and strategies. These variables include the End-
of-Day Inventory Ratio, Max. Intraday Inventory Ratio, Investment Horizon, and the
Aggressiveness Ratio, which are defined in Section III.A and calculated on the monthly
frequency for each HFT firm. Max. Intraday Inventory is used in the denominator to calculate
Returns and is thus omitted when Returns is the dependent variable.
The continuous independent variables, namely, log(Decision Latency) and the control
variables, are normalized to be in units of standard deviations. Month fixed-effects absorb time-
varying market conditions, including market trading volume and volatility. Following Petersen
(2009) and Thompson (2011), standard errors are dually clustered by firm and month to account
for correlations both across firms and over time. Table 4 reports coefficient estimates for various
specifications of the model described in Eq. (1).
INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE
23

Our first result is that being fast is associated with increased revenue. The first
specification sets all slope coefficients except that of nominal latency (𝛽 ) equal to zero and
1
shows a negative and statistically significant relation between Revenues and nominal latency.
The second result is that the effect of relative latency on Revenues dominates that of
nominal latency. This is seen in the second and third specifications, where the 𝟏 and
top 1 𝑖,𝑡
𝟏 indicators of relative latency are included along with the nominal latency variable in
top 1-5 𝑖,𝑡
the second specification, and along with control variables in the third specification. The lack of
statistical significance and reduced economic magnitude for log(Decision Latency) suggest that
relative speed matters more than nominal speed. Specifically, the estimates in Column 3 show
that being among the five fastest HFTs (Top 1-5) predicts average daily trading revenues that are
SEK 15,451 higher than the for the HFTs outside the top five. Being the fastest (Top 1) provides
on average daily trading revenues of SEK 24,639 in addition to the revenues from being in the
Top 1-5: the coefficient on the Top 1 dummy tests the difference in revenues between being Top
1 and Top 1-5, which is found to be statistically significant.23 HFTs that are not among the five
fastest in a given month have average daily revenues reflected by the intercept of SEK 10,894.
These numbers imply that the revenues of the fastest HFT firm are around five times higher than
those of the “slow” (non-Top 1-5) HFTs.
Several of the control variables are related to trading revenues. For example, a one
standard deviation increase in the Max. Intraday Inventory is associated with decreased daily
Revenues of 21,008 SEK, suggesting that HFTs that have tighter inventory management perform
better. Similarly, HFTs that are more aggressive earn somewhat higher trading revenues.
23 Appendix A6 repeats the analysis presented here but breaks down the Top 1-5 dummy variables into individual
dummy variables for the fastest HFTs: Top 1, Top 2, Top 3, Top 4, and Top 5. It shows that, even among the top five
HFTs, the faster firm tends to perform better and that performance is monotonic in relative latency.
24

The results for latency effects on risk-adjusted performance measures are similar to those
for Revenues. The only difference between Returns and Revenues is that the former is expressed
relative to the firm market capitalization. The results thus indicate that the HFT firm size does
not drive the relation between Revenues and relative latency. Furthermore, we find that the
Sharpe Ratio is higher for HFT firms with lower relative latency. This demonstrates that the
relation between Revenues and relative latency is not driven by the risk of the trading strategies
applied.
To understand why relative latency is important, we next analyze whether it is primarily
related to the trading revenues per trade (quality) or the number of trades (quantity). If HFTs use
latency advantages to better obtain and aggregate information in order to predict future price
changes we would expect the fastest HFTs to have the highest revenues per trade. However,
according to Table 4, we find only a weak statistical association between Decision Latency and
Revenues per MSEK Traded, and when the control variables are included the latency effects are
not stable. Instead, we find a strong relationship between trading speed and Trading Volume. The
results imply that faster HFTs are able to capture a larger trading quantity, but that trading speed
is not an important determinant of trading quality. It appears that the fastest HFTs are no more
accurate at processing new information per trade than other traders, but their latency advantage
allows them to capture the most trading opportunities. This result supports the use of a measure
of trade quantity, like Revenues, rather than a measure of trade quality, like Revenues per MSEK
Traded, when evaluating HFT performance.
The results presented in this section show that HFTs with relatively low latency are more
successful in capturing trading opportunities and earning higher revenues. To alleviate concerns
about a spurious relationship between speed and performance, in the next section we focus on a
quasi-experimental setting where the trading speed changes for some firms but not for others.
25

B. Evidence from two colocation upgrades
To address the potential endogeneity concern that another variable correlated with HFT
latency might be instead driving trading performance, we put forward evidence from a quasi-
experimental setting studying two colocation upgrades that cause some HFTs to increase their
relative speed.
On March 14, 2011 and September 17, 2012, NASDAQ OMX Stockholm implemented
optional upgrades to its colocation offerings (the “Premium Colocation” and “10G Colocation”
upgrades, respectively). Members subscribing to the previously fastest colocation service were
then offered to upgrade to an even faster connection. We study these events, which result in
some HFTs improving their latency rank, and find evidence in support of a causal relation
between relative latency and trading performance.
The September 17, 2012 colocation upgrade has been previously studied by Brogaard et
al. (2015), and background and institutional detail on this event can be found in that paper. In
particular, they find that only about half of the affected members immediately subscribed to the
new connection type. Likely as a result, we find that some, but not all, HFTs improve their
latency shortly after the upgrade becomes available.
Specifically, we measure Decision Latency before and after the event, and compare the
change in trading performance for HFTs that become relatively faster through the colocation
upgrade to HFTs that become relatively slower. Given that Decision Latency consists of firm-
month observations, we compare the latency of each firm the first full month before the
colocation upgrade to the second full month after the event; for consistency, we measure the
change in HFT performance for each firm over this same period. In measuring Decision Latency,
we skip a month after the colocation upgrade because it seems that HFTs take time to adopt and
exploit this new technology; we observe that the distribution across firms of Decision Latency
26

decreases and fully reaches a stable equilibrium by the second month. However, it is important to
note that the horizon for assessing performance does not matter: the difference-in-difference
results are robust to looking at the change in HFT performance in a 2, 4, 8, or 12 week period
before and after the upgrade.
We find two HFT firms for the March 14, 2011 event and one HFT firm for the
September 17, 2012 that improve their latency rank and refer to them as Faster. We compare that
group to three HFT firmss for the March 14, 2011 event and one HFT firm for the September 17,
2012 event that decline in latency rank, which we refer to as Slower. All other HFTs who have
unchanged relative latency – including some who get nominally, but not relatively, faster – are
excluded from this analysis.
Table 5 reports the trading performance measures for Faster and Slower HFTs, before
and after the colocation upgrade event. The results suggest that the group of HFTs that improve
their relative latency around the colocation upgrade (Faster) also improve their trading
performance. This result holds for all five measures of trading performance. The HFTs in the
Slower group also improve their Revenues and Revenues per MSEK Traded, but less so than the
Faster group. The Slower group also has a lower Trading Volume after the event, suggesting that
those HFTs capture fewer trading opportunities. As seen by the difference-in-difference estimate
in the bottom line of Table 5, the Faster group improves relative to the Slower group in terms of
all trading performance measures considered. For each performance measure, we test the null
hypothesis that there is no difference in the before-after change between the Faster and Slower
groups; the statistical significance of the difference-in-difference estimates is assessed with a t-
test, where a p-value is computed under the null by taking the before-after changes in
performance for each HFT firm as independent observations, pooling together the Faster and
27

Slower groups. There are seven firms with changing relative latency, yielding six degrees of
freedom.
INSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE
The difference-in-difference estimates are large, positive, and often statistically
significant due to the consistency and magnitude of the change, despite the small sample size.
Notably, the relative improvement is statistically significant and much stronger for the quantity
measures and risk-adjusted measures than for the quality measure Revenues per MSEK Traded,
which is not statistically significant. The findings are thus consistent with the evidence presented
in the previous section.
Given the small sample of firms that get relatively faster or slower, the evidence
presented in Table 5 should be seen as suggestive. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with
the notion that improved relative latency leads to a boost in trading performance, in particular in
terms of quantity performance measures.
C. Alternative Latency Measures
We acknowledge two potential concerns about the Decision Latency metric. First,
measuring Decision Latency requires both limit and market orders, potentially discriminating
against HFTs that do not mix order types. Second, the microsecond time stamps reported by
TRTH are not assigned when the trading venue receives an order, but when the information
about the order arrives at the TRTH servers. Variation in the delay within venue can potentially
introduce time-stamp noise in the Decision Latency metric, though we expect it to be mitigated
by two factors: first, time-series variation in the delay is presumably stronger over longer time
periods than within milliseconds, over which Decision Latency is measured; and, second,
28

variation across venues due to geographical distance does not influence Decision Latency, which
only uses time stamps from within the same venue.
Nevertheless, to address these concerns, we consider two alternative approaches to
measuring HFT latency. We construct two additional latency measures, Queuing Latency and
Mean Latency, and re-estimate the results of Table 4, which analyzes the connection between
latency and various measures of HFT performance. The results are qualitatively unchanged.
To mitigate the time stamp noise, we measure Mean Latency. We use the same
distribution of latencies as for Decision Latency, but instead of calculating the 0.1% quantile, we
define Mean Latency as the mean of all latencies that are shorter than one millisecond. By using
a central moment rather than an extreme quantile, we expect the time-stamp noise to cancel out,
relying on the central limit theorem. This approach comes at the cost of not picking the cases
where HFTs operate at their very fastest speed.
Our second alternative latency measure, Queuing Latency, circumvents both concerns
described above. For this measure, we exploit price changes that lead to a gap in the limit order
book. As modelled by Yueshen (2014), if the price change is viewed as temporary, fast traders
rush in to capture the top-of-queue limit order position in the emerging gap. When the price
changes and a new tick opens up, Queuing Latency measures how often each HFT firm submits
the first limit order and thus gets to the top of the queue. A higher value corresponds to lower
latency. Note that this measure does not use time stamps and, furthermore, that simply more
trading or limit order submissions does not help one get to the top of the queue: given the brief
window when a new tick opens up, the chances of a randomly submitted order ending up first is
negligible.
The measurement procedure for Queuing Latency involves the following three steps.
First, we identify trades that consumes all available liquidity at a price level (gap-opening
29

trades). Second, for each gap-opening trade we identify the next trade at the same price level as
the gap-filling trade. We retain the passive counterparty of all gap-filling trades that: (i) are in
the same direction as the corresponding gap-opening trades; (ii) occur within 10 seconds after the
corresponding gap-opening trades; (iii) do not have the same broker as buyer and seller; (iv) do
not have the same passive counterparty as the corresponding gap-opening trades.24
We repeat the analysis in Table 4 for the two alternative measures of latency and report
the findings in Table 6. As in Section IV.A, we use the alternative latency measures to rank
HFTs by latency in each month and construct new Top 1 and Top 1-5 rank dummies. Note that in
Panel A, which looks at Queuing Latency, we represent nominal latency with log(Queuing
Latency + 1), so that we do not take the log of zero, which is the lowest possible value that
Queuing Latency can attain.
INSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE
Panel A reports the results for Queuing Latency. In Column 1, there is an association
between nominal speed and trading performance. In contrast to Table 4, we expect a positive
coefficient, since lower latency is represented by a higher value of Queuing Latency. In Columns
2 and 3, when the Top 1 and Top 1-5 rank dummies are added, the coefficient on nominal latency
now becomes insignificantly different from zero, while the magnitudes of the estimates on the
Top 1 and Top 1-5 rank dummies are large and significant. Thus, as before, relative latency is
more important than nominal latency. Similar results can be seen for Returns, the Sharpe Ratio,
24 The reasoning behind the criteria is as follows. (i) This criterion avoids cases where the market order leading to
the gap-opening trade posts its residual volume as a limit order. That is a mechanical way to cease the top-of-queue
position. Execution of such limit orders is however always in the opposite direction relative the gap-opening trade.
(ii) This criterion ensures that there really is a race to capture the trading opportunity. (iii) This criterion avoids the
influence of the internal priority rule at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. Under this rule, a broker with a limit order
posted at a given price level has priority to be executed if a market order from the same broker is executed at that
price. (iv) This criterion ensures that we do not capture iceberg orders that automatically converts hidden liquidity to
visible if the previously visible part of the order is executed.
30

and Trading Volume. However, as usual for the quality measure, Revenues per MSEK Traded,
the results are small in magnitude and not significant.
Panel B reports the results for Mean Latency and tells a similar story. The only main
difference between Panel B and Table 4 is that the coefficient on the Top 1-5 rank dummy is
generally statistically significant, but the one on Top 1 is not, although it is still generally
positive and large in magnitude. So while being relatively fast according to this measure is still
important, as reflected in the coefficient on the Top 1-5 dummy, Mean Latency may not be the
best measure to capture the very fastest HFTs at their peak potential, when extreme low latencies
are needed to outperform competitors. Nevertheless, as a central tendency and not an extreme
value, Mean Latency is useful for assessing the robustness of our main measure, Decision
Latency.
V. How does Latency Impact Performance?
The theoretical literature identifies two channels through which traders benefit from
being fast: short-lived information and risk management. The benefit of low latency through
short-lived information is explored by Foucault et al. (2016). They show that fast traders trade
aggressively on news, picking off stale quotes. Furthermore, Biais et al. (2015) and Foucault et
al. (2015) show that fast traders can benefit from a superior ability to react to cross-market
arbitrage opportunities. Chaboud, Chiquoine, Hjalmarsson and Vega (2014) provide empirical
evidence of fast traders pursuing cross-market arbitrage. The benefit of low latency in risk
management is highlighted by Hoffmann (2014), who emphasizes that low latency allows
liquidity providers to reduce their adverse selection costs, by revising stale quotes before they are
picked off. Aït-Sahalia and Saglam (2014) add that fast traders can also benefit in terms of
reduced inventory risk, which is supported empirically by Brogaard et al. (2015).
31

In this section we investigate specifically how latency influences the two channels
discussed above. We find that relative latency determines ability in both short-lived information
trading and risk management.
A. Short-Lived Information and Risk Management in General
To capture trading on short-lived information, we measure active Price Impact as the
basis point change in the bid-ask spread midpoint from just before a trade initiated by an HFT
firm to ten seconds after. To capture risk management, we measure passive Realized Spread as
the basis point difference between the transaction price and the bid-ask spread midpoint ten
seconds after a trade where an HFT firm is the liquidity provider. Realized Spread captures the
benefit of earning a wide bid-ask spread, as well as the ability to avoid supplying liquidity to
trades with price impact. Each measure is calculated on a firm-stock-month frequency as the
SEK-volume-weighted average across all trades of a given firm in each stock and each month.
We interact both Realized Spread and Price Impact with a ±1 buy-sell indicator variable, such
that a higher coefficient corresponds to better trading performance. As the analysis requires
information on the bid-ask spread, we limit the measures to trades that can be matched to order
book data, both contemporary to the trade and ten seconds later.
We re-estimate Eq. (1) at the firm-stock-month level with Price Impact and Realized
Spread as the dependent variables. Unlike in Table 4, we disaggregate by stock to control for
stock-level characteristics, such as the Quoted Spread and Tick Size, which may affect Price
Impact and Realized Spread. As before, the 𝟏 and 𝟏 are indicators that capture
top 1 𝑖,𝑡 top 1-5 𝑖,𝑡
relative latency, whereas log(Decision Latency) captures nominal latency. The estimation is run
with and without control variables.
32

The control variables include both HFT firm characteristics and stock characteristics. The
HFT firm characteristics are End-of-day Inventory, Max. Intraday Inventory, Investment
Horizon, and Aggressiveness Ratio, defined as in Section III.A. Since these variables are firm-
characteristics, they are assigned the same value across stocks. The stock characteristics are
measured on stock-month frequency and are defined as in Section II.B: Volatility, Fragmentation
Index, Tick Size, and Quoted Spread. The Non-HFT Trading Volume is the daily sum of SEK
trading volume in each stock that does not involve HFTs. All continuous independent variables
are in units of standard deviations. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm-stock and month.
The results are reported in Table 7.
INSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE
As with HFT performance in general, we find for the specific channels that relative
latency, not nominal latency, drives performance. The coefficients for the 𝟏 relative
top 1-5 𝑖,𝑡
latency dummy is statistically significant and economically meaningful for both the Price Impact
and the Realized Spread. For example, being in the Top 1-5 by speed increases Price Impact by
0.645 bps, which can be related to the intercept of 3.96 bps. That means that the five fastest
HFTs have 16% (0.645 / 3.96) higher price impact than other HFTs. In addition, the fastest HFT
outperforms the price impact of other HFTs by another 0.34 basis points (0.34 / 3.96 = 9%). For
the Realized Spread the Top 1-5 coefficient is 0.477 bps, whereas the intercept is insignificantly
different from zero. This indicates that being among the fastest HFTs is important for being
successful at the risk management required for passive trading. The results are robust to
inclusion of the control variables.
We conclude that relative latency is important both for improving trading on short-lived
information and for risk management. This is consistent with theoretical models, such as
33

Foucault et al. (2016) on active trading; and Hoffmann (2014) and Aït-Sahalia and Saglam
(2014) on passive trading.
B. Short-Lived Information and Risk Management in Cross-Market Arbitrage
In a more controlled environment we re-examine both channels by focusing on cross-
market trading between the futures market and equities. Specifically, we test if faster HFTs are
more likely than slower HFTs to actively trade in equities in quick response to “news” in the
futures market, where “news” is defined to be a price change in the OMXS30 futures above a
certain size. We also ask whether faster HFTs are less likely than slower HFTs to be adversely
selected in a passive trade in equities markets in response to “news” in the futures market. The
investigation is in line with the theoretical setup of active fast trading by Biais et al. (2015) and
Foucault et al. (2015).
We estimate the following probit regression, which in essence follows the setup of
Hendershott and Riordan (2013) and Brogaard et al. (2015):
Pr[𝐹𝑎𝑠𝑡 𝐻𝐹𝑇 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑠] = Φ[𝛽 𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑠+𝛾′𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠+ 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝐹𝐸𝑠]. (2)
The unit of observation is a trade. To capture who is trading quickly in response to
“news” in the futures market, we consider equity market trades in the 1-second interval
subsequent to a “news” event in the futures market. We define Fast HFT as being either Top 1 or
Top 1-5 of HFTs in terms of Decision Latency in each month; Slow HFT are those not among the
top five. The dependent variable is 1 when a Fast HFT executes an equities trade in the
subsequent 1-second and 0 if a Slow HFT does it. Thus, our results can be interpreted as the
increased probability of a Fast HFT trading in equities relative to a Slow HFT, in response to
“news” in the futures market.
34

News is defined to be ±1 when the return on the OMXS30 futures during a one-second
window preceding the stock trade is large, defined as when the absolute return exceeds the top
decile among non-zero absolute returns of that month, and 0 otherwise. News takes the value +1
if the active party trades in direction of the news, and -1 if in the opposite direction. This design
implies that News reflects any event that causes a large price change in the futures index. Note
that all sample stocks are constituents of the index underlying the futures contract, making
arbitrage activities between the two markets likely (Hasbrouck, 2003).
We also control for the following variables, which may affect the probability of Fast
HFTs doing cross-market arbitrage. Lagged Volatility is the average second-by-second squared
return (multiplied by 1,000) over the previous ten seconds; Lagged Volume is the SEK trading
volume (divided by 100,000) over the previous ten seconds; Quoted Spread is defined as before;
and Depth at BBO is the average number of shares available at the best bid quote and the best
offer quote (divided by 100,000), multiplied by the bid-ask spread midpoint.
Estimates for active trading, the sample being all trades initiated through the submission
of a market order by a HFT firm, are reported in Table 8, Panel A. Similarly, the estimates for
passive trading, the sample being all trades where liquidity is provided by an HFT firm, are
presented in Panel B. For computational tractability, regressions are run monthly for all month in
2010-2014. Similar to the Fama and Macbeth (1973) procedure, the monthly coefficients are
averaged across months to produce the estimates reported in Table 8. To assess the economic
magnitudes, we report marginal effects. The marginal effects show the increased probability of
Fast HFTs to engage in a trade if the explanatory variable increases by one standard deviation,
conditional on all other explanatory variables being at their unconditional means.
INSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE
35

We find that the News coefficients are positive and statistically significant for active
trading (Panel A). Based on the marginal effects, the fastest HFT firm (Top 1) is 0.6% more
likely to actively trade in equities subsequent to “news” arrival in the futures market, relative a
trader outside of the Top 5. The Top 1-5 HFTs show similar results. Overall, we conclude that
faster HFTs are more likely to quickly submit market orders in response to changes in the futures
index. This is consistent with fast active traders being better positioned to pursue cross-market
arbitrage, as modeled by Biais et al. (2015) and Foucault et al. (2015). For passive trading, the
News coefficients are negative (Panel B), indicating that fast HFTs are less likely to get caught in
a passive equities trades that incur adverse selection costs to the liquidity provider. The result is
not statistically significant for the Top 1 HFT firm, but is statistically significant at the 1% level
for the Top 1-5 HFTs. This is in line with Foucault et al. (2015), who find that the probability of
toxic arbitrage is related to the latency of arbitrageurs relative the latency of liquidity providers.
VI. Implications of Speed for the HFT Industry
Sections IV and V show that relative differences in latency can help explain the variation
in HFT performance. If trading speed drives performance, why are HFT firms not competing
away their trading revenues, either through new entry, higher trading volumes, or increased
investment in speed and trading sophistication?
According to the traditional view of market-making competition (Ho and Stoll, 1983;
Weston 2000), the alpha generated by HFTs and the concentration of revenues should disappear
as the industry matures. Alternatively, if HFTs compete on relative latency, then increased
competition should not drive profit opportunities to zero. As argued by Budish et al. (2015),
regardless of how fast the market as a whole becomes, there is always at least one firm with a
relative speed advantage that can adversely select other traders. Additionally, rents remain
36

concentrated among the fastest HFTs, as slower HFTs arrive marginally too late to trading
opportunities to compete.
We explore some of the prediction of relative latency regarding market concentration.25
The HFT literature on competition on relative latency makes several predictions: persistence in
performance, both at the firm-level and industry-wide level, high concentration of HFT revenues
and trading volume, and difficulty of new entry. We examine each of these predictions and find
evidence that all apply for the HFT industry.
A. Persistence in Firm-Level Performance
We first test for persistence at the firm-level. Large differences in HFT firm performance
could potentially be driven by luck. For instance, in a model of identically skilled HFTs, all
engaging in strategies with right-skewed distributions of performance, some will happen to
outperform. Persistence shows that something other than luck drives a firm’s performance.
There is an extant literature showing that performance for actively-managed mutual funds
in period t generally does not predict performance in period t+1 (Carhart, 1997). However, there
is evidence of persistence by some investors (Jagannathan, Malakhov, and Novikov, 2010, for
hedge funds; and Kaplan and Schoar, 2004, for private equity). Nonetheless, the expectation for
most types of investors and funds is little persistence in performance.
To analyze persistence we regress various measures of performance (Revenues, Revenues
per MSEK Traded, Returns, and the Sharpe Ratio) on their lagged values, on both the daily and
monthly frequency (except for the Sharpe Ratio, which is available on the monthly frequency
25 Other papers that study competition in the HFT industry include: Boehmer, Li, and Saar (2015), who study
competition between HFTs within three distinct strategies and show that increased competition is associated with
lower volatility and the migration of trading volume to newer venues; and Brogaard and Garriott (2015), who
analyze entry and exit of HFTs and show that increased HFT competition increases market liquidity. Geroski,
Gilbert, and Jacquemin (1990) provide an overview of the literature on imperfect competition.
37

only). Measures of performance are standardized in the cross section. That is, on each day, firm-
level performance is centered on the mean and scaled by the standard deviation across firms. The
standardization controls for potential time-variation in the mean and variance of returns. We also
estimate persistence regressions with rank-order performance, ranking the relative performance
of firms as 1, 2, 3, etc., for each measure of performance on each day or month. We estimate the
following regression using OLS:
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 𝛽 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 +𝜖 , (3)
𝑖,𝑡 𝑖,𝑡−1 𝑖,𝑡
where 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 is defined as above. Results based on daily observations are reported in
𝑖,𝑡
Table 9, Panel A, and those using monthly observations are reported in Panel B. Since each
measure is standardized in the cross-section, the constant term in the regression model is
mechanically zero. We refer to 𝛽 as the persistence coefficient, with 𝛽 = 1 meaning perfect
persistence and 𝛽 = 0 meaning no persistence. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm and
day in Panel A and by firm and month in Panel B.
INSERT TABLE 9 ABOUT HERE
We find that HFTs have statistically significant daily persistence coefficients of 0.235 for
Revenues and 0.387 for Returns. On the monthly frequency, we find higher persistence
coefficients: 0.631 for Revenues, 0.763 for the Sharpe Ratio, and 0.446 for Returns. Performance
is more persistent at the monthly level, which is likely due to the higher idiosyncratic risk in
daily observations. The rank order analysis shows similar persistence. Consistent with our earlier
argument that Revenues per MSEK Traded may be a less relevant performance metric for HFTs,
we find lower persistence in this measure.
38

In summary, we find that the performance of HFTs is relatively stable over time, in terms
of nominal performance as well as in terms of performance rankings. Firms that have done well
in the past typically continue to outperform their competitors in the future.
B. Persistence in Industry-Wide Performance
Having found evidence of persistence in firm-level performance we examine overall
performance of the HFT industry over our five year sample. Given that the HFT industry is
relatively new, we may observe decreasing industry-wide performance if competition is
increasing over time. However, in a market with competition on relative speed, performance may
not change. Budish et al. (2015), for example, argue that if HFTs compete on relative latency,
regardless of how fast the market as a whole becomes, there will always be a relatively fastest
firm that can use its speed advantage to adversely slower traders, capturing a stable level of rents
regardless of nominal speed differences. Furthermore, if competition on relative speed makes
new entry difficult, as we show in Section VI.D, difficulty of new entry may keep aggregate
HFT performance from declining.
Consistent with these predictions, we find that the HFT industry-wide performance is
relatively stable over the five-year sample. Table 10, Panel A, reports average daily statistics
aggregated across all HFTs and all stocks and reported in half-year intervals. The statistics
include Total Daily Revenues (Revenues summed across all HFTs), Average Daily Revenues (the
Total Daily Revenues averaged across HFTs), Average Revenues per MSEK Traded (the ratio of
Total Daily Revenues and Daily Trading Volume), and Daily Trading Volume (the Trading
Volume summed across all HFTs and reported in MSEK). Time trends for Total Daily Revenues
and Average Daily Revenues are also plotted in Figure 2, Panels A and B.
39

INSERT TABLE 10 ABOUT HERE
INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE
Our results show that Total Daily Revenues and Average Daily Revenues are relatively
stable over the five-year period.26 Interestingly, as shown in Figure 2, Panel B, Daily Trading
Volume per Firm trends up while Average Revenues per MSEK Traded trends down, but the ratio
of the two, HFT Revenues per Firm, is stable. One possible interpretation is that as HFTs are
presumably competing more by increasing trading volume and pursuing ever-lower latencies,
they are chasing the same number of profit opportunities, so the resulting HFT revenues per firm
is the same.
To formally test the movement of the trends, we estimate the following OLS regression
on daily observations:
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 𝛼+𝛽 (𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟−2010)+𝜖 , (4)
𝑡 𝑡
where 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 is one of the performance measures described above, and year is a
𝑡
continuous variable (e.g., year would take on the approximate value of 2014.25 on March 31,
2014). A positive (negative) coefficient on the (𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟−2010) variable corresponds to an
increasing (decreasing) trend in the HFT industry-wide performance over the period 2010-2014.
Newey-West standard errors with 30 day lags are used. The coefficient estimates are presented in
Table 10, Panel B.
The tests statistically confirm the aforementioned trends. However, there is statistical
evidence that trading revenues are slightly increasing over the sample period: a yearly increase of
26 Returns slightly trend down, but, given the relative stability of revenues per firm, this mechanically must mean
that average firm capitalization is slightly increasing over the sample.
40

22,682 SEK for Total Daily Revenues, relative to a baseline of 166,484 SEK in the first half of
2010. This increase is however not statistically significant in terms of Average Daily Revenues,
which takes the number of HFTs in the industry into account.
We also examine time trends in the cost of HFT activities for non-HFTs, which is defined
as HFT Total Daily Revenues divided by Non-HFT Trading Volume, calculated on a daily basis.
This measure captures the amount of revenue paid from non-HFTs to HFTs per SEK traded. The
cost of HFT activities for non-HFTs is relatively small, varying between 0.113 and 0.426 bps,
depending on the month, which is about the same order of magnitude as typical exchange fees
(see Appendix Section A6). Whereas the exchange fees are direct costs incurred to exchange
members and typically passed on to their clients, the cost of HFT activities is extracted indirectly
through the trading process. Another way to put the cost of HFT activities into perspective is to
compare it to the effective spread, which according to Table 1 is between 2 and 6 bps. That is,
the cost of crossing the (half) bid-ask spread is more than ten times higher than the cost of HFT
activities for non-HFTs. As seen in Figure 2, Panel C, and formally tested in the last column of
Table 10, Panel B, there is a small upward time trend in the cost of HFT activities, starting from
around 0.13 bps and increasing by about 0.06 on average per year.
Thus, despite concerns that HFTs competing on relative latency might impose costs on
non-HFTs, the average observed cost of HFT activities for non-HFTs is surprisingly small.
C. HFT Market Concentration over Time
We next turn to investigate HFT market concentration. While high concentration by itself
need not signify lack of competition, there may be reasons why high concentration might be of
concern in the context of HFTs. For example, a high concentration among market intermediaries
could adversely affect market stability. For example, a dominant HFT firm that incurs a technical
41

malfunction, suffers large capital losses, or suddenly withdraws its liquidity supply could lead to
market fragility.
We show that the HFT industry concentration remains high and relatively constant over
the five-year sample. We calculate Herfindahl indices, a commonly used measure of
concentration of market share or earnings within an industry, for both Revenues and Trading
Volume. The Herfindahl Industry Concentration by Revenues is calculated as:
2
𝐻𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑎ℎ𝑙 = ∑𝑁 [ 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠 𝑖,𝑡 ] , (5)
𝑖,𝑡 𝑖=1
𝐻𝐹𝑇 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡
where N is the number of firms in month t that earn non-negative trading revenues, Revenues is
i,t
firm i’s total trading revenues in month t, and HFT Revenues is the trading revenues summed
t
across all HFT firms. Herfindahl Industry Concentration by Volumes is calculated using the
same formula but considering Trading Volume instead of trading Revenues. A larger index
implies a more concentrated industry: the index is at its minimum 1/N when all HFT firms have
the same share of the industry and at its maximum of 1 when all activity is concentrated to one
firm.
As with the trading performance time trends, the Herfindahl indices are first calculated
for each trading day, then averaged across trading days of each half-year block in the data set.
Standard deviations are reported in parentheses. Results are reported in Table 10, Panel A, and
graphed in Figure 2, Panel D.
The Herfindahl industry concentration in terms of volume lies in the range from 0.186 to
0.304. In terms of revenues, the corresponding interval is from 0.275 to 0.354. As a reference,
Van Ness, Van Ness, and Warr (2005) find that market makers have an average Herfindahl index
in terms of trading volume on NASDAQ of 0.14, with a range of 0.037 to 0.439.
42

We test for a time trend in industry concentration by estimating the following OLS
regression:
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝛼 +𝛽 (𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟−2010)+𝜖 , (6)
𝑡 𝑡
where year is a continuous variable and Concentration is one of the concentration measures
t
discussed above. The coefficient estimates are reported in Table 10, Panel B.
We find no statistically significant time trend for revenues concentration. There is a
statistically significant decrease in trading volume concentration, but it is not economically
significant. The Herfindahl industry concentration by volume decreases by 0.009 per year from
its starting value of 0.292 in the first-half of 2010. The overall conclusion with respect to
industry concentration is however that it is relatively constant over the five years.
D. Entry and Exit
To investigate competition in the HFT industry, we examine the properties of firms that
just entered the market. New entrants can potentially introduce competition and drive down both
firm-level and industry-wide profits. However, frictions in labor markets may prevent the
movement of human capital and technical knowledge to new HFTs. For instance, technological
expertise and trading strategies are closely guarded trade secrets and employees often agree to
non-compete and non-disclosure agreements, preventing them from simply starting new firms or
moving to competitors. If new entrants cannot simply pay to acquire skill but require experience,
then they may earn less and be less likely to survive in the market.
To evaluate the importance of experience, we regress performance measures on indicator
variables for the length of time an HFT firm has been active in a given stock, designating less
than 1 month, 2 months or 3 months as indicators of new entry.
43

We estimate the following regression model using OLS:
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 𝛽 𝟏 +𝛽 𝟏 + 𝛽 𝟏
𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 1 one-month 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 2 two-month 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 1 three-month 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡
+ (day x stock)-FEs+𝜖 , (7)
𝑖,𝑗,𝑡
where 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 can be Revenues, Revenues per MSEK Traded, or Returns, and is
𝑖,𝑗,𝑡
defined on a firm-stock-day frequency over the period 2010-2014. We exclude the observations
in the first three months of the sample, since new entry during this period cannot be established.
The notation 𝟏 takes the value 1 if firm i began trading stock j in the last 30
𝑜𝑛𝑒−𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡
calendar days, otherwise it takes the value 0; similarly, the 𝟏 dummy corresponds
𝑡𝑤𝑜−𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡
to beginning trading in stock j in the last 31-60 days, and the 𝟏 dummy
𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑒−𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡
corresponds to the previous 61-90 days.27 If new entrants are less competitive and perform worse
than established firms, the coefficient on the one-month dummy should be negative, and,
consistent with experience mattering, the two- and three-month dummy coefficients should also
be negative though less so. The results are reported in Table 11. Standard errors are dually
clustered by firm-stock and by month and are reported within parentheses.
INSERT TABLE 11 ABOUT HERE
Looking at Revenues, HFTs have statistically significant negative coefficients
corresponding to the new entry dummies, with the negative value of -1,900 SEK for the 1-month
dummy, -3,050 SEK for 2 months, and -780 SEK for 3 months. Returns are also significantly
27 In accounting for entry and exit, we ignore gaps and just count the overall first and last trading days of a firm in a
stock as entry and exit dates. HFT firm mergers (of which there are two in our sample) are also not counted as
entry/exit events.
44

lower for new entrants in the first and second month. However, Revenues per MSEK Traded is
statistically insignificant for all three time periods. The fact that the new firms have lower total
trading revenues but no statistically significant difference in Revenues per MSEK Traded is
consistent with HFTs competing on quantity, not quality, and new firms being less able to
compete on capturing quantity.
Additionally, we examine whether new entrants are more likely to exit the market by
estimating the model described in Eq. (7) with the dummy Exit as the dependent variable,
i,j,t
which takes the value 1 on day t for firm i if that is the last day firm i trades stock j. In this
analysis we exclude observations in December 2014, the last month of the analysis, as we are
unable to determine market exit in that month. The model is estimated as a linear probability
regression, and the results are in Table 11.
We find that, on average, a new entrant in a stock has a higher probability of exit
compared to more established HFTs. The effect is found in the one- and two-month indicator
variables, both being statistically significant at the 1% level. The daily probability of exit is a
statistically significant and economically large amount of 1.4% in the first month. The increased
probability of exit is for each day, not the cumulative probability of exit at any future point,
making the magnitude substantial.
Why do new entrants typically perform worse than established firms? Given our previous
findings on latency, we examine whether new entrants are slower than the incumbent HFTs.
Repeating the analysis in Eq. (7) but replacing the dependent variable with the Decision Latency
measure (expressed in milliseconds), we find statistically significant coefficients on the 1-month,
45

2-month, and 3-month dummies of 44.36, 134.6, and 22.8 milliseconds.28 The positive
coefficients on the indicator variables show that new entrants are slower than established firms,
which might in part explain their lower trading revenues.
In summary, we find that new entrants tend to perform worse and are more likely to exit
than established HFTs. This finding helps explain the continued concentration of revenues
among a small subset of established firms: if new entrants tend to exit, then the concentration of
revenues continues. A high and steady industry concentration combined with strong firm-level
persistence of Revenues and Returns suggests that top performing incumbent HFTs maintain
their position in the market. Together, the four measures of industry structure we examine point
to high concentration, consistent with relative latency driving performance.
VII. Conclusion
We study the role of latency in the performance of HFT firms. We document a number
of statistics consistent with superior investment performance by HFTs. There are large cross-
sectional differences in performance in the HFT industry, with trading revenues
disproportionally accumulating to a few firms. The fastest firms tend to earn the largest trading
revenues. While latency decreases substantially over our five-year sample period, we show that it
is relative latency, not nominal latency, that helps explain the differences in performance across
HFTs.
Furthermore, we examine how speed may be used in specific HFT strategies. We find
evidence that relative latency is important for success in trading on short-lived information, for
risk management in liquidity provision, and for cross-market arbitrage.
28 Our definition of Decision Latency does not allow for variation across stocks. For the purpose of this regression
we construct a firm-stock-day panel, where all observations across stocks for a given firm-day are assigned the same
Decision Latency value.
46

Finally, we explore implications of competition on relative latency regarding HFT
concentration. If small differences in latency are important, then the HFT industry should be
characterized by persistence in performance, high concentration, and difficulty of new entry. We
find evidence that is consistent with these predictions. Firm trading performance is persistent,
trading revenues are high and non-declining, as is HFT concentration, and new HFT entrants
tend to be slower, underperform, and are more likely to exit.

Figure 1: HFT Decision Latency over time
This figure plots Decision Latency (indicated on the vertical axis on a log scale) from January 2010 to
December 2014. For each firm-month, Decision Latency is recorded as the 0.1% quantile of a distribution
of latencies between a passive trade followed by an active trade at the same venue, in the same stock,
within one second. HFT #1 is the Decision Latency of the fastest HFT firm in each month; HFTs #1-5 is
the average Decision Latency of the 5 fastest HFTs in each month; and All HFTs is the average Decision
Latency across all HFTs for which latency is lower than one second in the given month. The vertical bars
indicate microstructure events at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm that are expected to be associated with
changes in latency. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks.

Figure 2: HFT revenues, cost of HFT activities, and industry concentration over time
This figure shows various time series trends. Panel A plots Total Daily Revenues, which is the average
daily sum of Revenues (defined as in Table 2) across all HFT firms. Panel B plots Firm-Average Daily
Revenues, which is the average Revenues across all HFT firms active on each given day. This variable is
equivalent to SEK Trading Volume per Firm times Revenues per MSEK Traded, which are also plotted.
Panel C plots the Cost of HFT Activities to Non-HFTs, calculated as HFT Total Daily Revenues divided
by the total non-HFT trading volume (in SEK). Panel D plots two indexes of HFT Industry
Concentration: Herfindahl indexes calculated on daily Revenues or with daily Trading Volumes, see Eq.
(5). The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading (January 2010 to December
2014). The time series are reported on a biannual frequency.

Table 1: Stock characteristics
This table reports summary statistics of the 25 Swedish stocks in the sample. Market Capitalization is
based on the closing price on December 31, 2014 (expressed in MSEK). All other statistics are calculated
as averages across trading days in December 2014. Because SCVb is delisted in May 2014, the metrics for
that stock are based on April 2014. Daily Trading Volume refers to trading at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
only  and  is  reported  in  MSEK.  Daily  Turnover  is  the  Daily  Trading  Volume  divided  by  Market
Capitalization, expressed in percentage points. Tick Size is the average minimum price change; Quoted
Spread is the average bid-ask spread prevailing just before each trade; and Effective Spread is the trade
value-weighted average absolute difference between the trade price and the bid-ask midpoint. All spread
measures are based on continuous trading at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, expressed relative to the bid-
ask spread, and presented in basis points. The Tick Size and the Quoted Spread are halved to be
comparable to the Effective Spread. Volatility is the average 10-second squared returns, calculated from
bid-ask midpoints. The Fragmentation Index is the inverse of a Herfindahl index of trading volumes
across the  five  largest trading venues  (BATS, Burgundy,  Chi-X, NASDAQ  OMX Stockholm, and
Turquoise); a higher value signifies greater fragmentation. The table is sorted by Market Capitalization.

Table 2: The cross-section of HFT performance
This table reports descriptive statistics on HFT performance and trading characteristics in the cross-section of HFT firms. The following variables
underlying the statistics are first aggregated for each day over all stocks and venues and then averaged across time for each HFT; the resulting cross-
sectional distribution across HFT firms is then presented. Revenues is the average daily trading revenue for each HFT firm, calculated as cash received
from selling shares, minus the cash paid from buying shares, plus the value of any outstanding positions at the end-of-day marked to the market price at
close; Trading Volume is the average daily trading volume for each HFT firm, measured in MSEK; Revenues per MSEK Traded is daily Revenues divided
by daily Trading Volume for each HFT firm; Returns is daily Revenues divided by the maximum intraday inventory position over the entire sample (used
as a measure of capitalization) and reported in annualized terms; Sharpe Ratio is the average monthly ratio for each HFT firm, reported in annualized
terms,  of the average daily return divided by the standard deviation of daily returns; the 1-factor Alpha is the intercept estimated in a regression of daily
HFT excess returns on the market return factor; the 3-factor Alpha is the intercept estimated in a regression of daily HFT excess returns on the Fama-
French factors; the 4-factor Alpha is the intercept estimated in a regression of daily HFT excess returns on the Fama-French and Carhart momentum
factors; End-of-Day Inventory Ratio is the absolute end-of-day SEK position (netted across stocks) divided by the Trading Volume; Max. Intraday
Inventory Ratio is the maximum absolute intraday SEK inventory position divided by the daily Trading Volume; Investment Horizon is the median
holding time in seconds across all trades, calculated on a first-in-first-out basis; Aggressiveness Ratio is the SEK volume traded using market orders
divided by the Trading Volume; and Decision Latency is the 0.1% quantile of a distribution of latencies recorded in each firm-month where a passive
trade is followed by an active trade at the same venue, in the same stock, within one second (measured in microseconds elapsed between the two trades of
each event), averaged across months for each HFT firm. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading (January 2010 to December
2014).

Table 3: Trading revenues, costs, and profits from public filings
This table reports Trading Revenues, Trading Costs, Trading Profit Margins, and Trading Returns calculated from annual reports and IPO prospectuses
for five high-frequency trading firms for which public data is available. Trading Costs are broken down into several categories, all expressed as a percent
of trading revenues. Trading Profit Margin is calculated as (1 - Trading Costs), and Trading Returns are calculated two ways based on two capitalization
measures: as Trading Revenues / (Trading Assets Minus Trading Liabilities) and as (Trading Revenues / Book Equity). All quantities are in million USD,
except for the firm Flow Traders, which is in million EUR.

and Trading Volume are calculated at a daily level for each HFT firm aggregated across stocks and then averaged across trading days in each month to get firm-month
observations; and the Sharpe Ratio is calculated as firm-month observations using the mean and standard deviation of daily observations of Revenues aggregated across
stocks. We estimate OLS regressions with month fixed effects. The independent variables considered are as follows: log(Decision Latency) is the natural logarithm of
Decision Latency (defined as in Table 2). Top 1 and Top 1-5 are indicator variables for whether a given firm is ranked among the top 1 or top 1-5 firms by Decision Latency
in a given month. The End-of-Day Inventory Ratio, Max. Intraday Inventory Ratio, Investment Horizon, and the Aggressiveness Ratio are defined as in Table 2. All
continuous independent variables are in units of standard deviations. We omit Max. Intraday Inventory Ratio as a control when estimating Returns as the dependent variable,
because Max. Intraday Inventory ratio is used in the denominator to calculate returns. *, ** and *** correspond to statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%,
respectively. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm and month and are reported in parentheses. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading
(January 2010 to December 2014).

Table 5: Relative latency and trading performance around colocation upgrades
This table examines the relationship between trading performance and latency around two colocation upgrades on March 14, 2011 and September 17, 2012.
Specifically, it analyzes two groups of HFT firms that experience a change in their latency rank around each event: firms that improve their rank in terms of
Decision Latency are in the Faster group, and firms that decline their rank are in the Slower group. The table then reports the change in average trading
performance around the colocation events. The trading measures Revenue, Returns, Revenues per MSEK Traded, and Trading Volume are calculated at a daily
level for each HFT and then averaged across trading days and HFTs for each period and group; and the Sharpe Ratio is calculated using the mean and
standard deviation of daily observations of Revenues. The difference between the Before and After periods are reported for each group and each variable. The
bottom row of the table reports the difference-in-difference estimate between groups. We test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the before-after
change between the Faster and Slower groups; the statistical significance of the difference-in-difference estimates is assessed with a t-test, where a p-value is
computed under the null by taking the before-after changes in performance for each HFT firm as independent observations, pooling together the Faster and
Slower groups (there are N = 7 firms with changing relative latency, yielding six degrees of freedom).

Table 6: Alternative latency measures
This table is similar to Table 4 but analyzes two alternative latency measures: Queuing Latency (Panel A), which counts the cases where an HFT firm captures the top-
of-queue position in a limit-order book gap; and Mean Latency (Panel B), the mean of a distribution of latencies in each firm-month where a passive trade is followed by
an active trade at the same venue, in the same stock, within one millisecond. The construction of these alternative latency measures and their relationship to HFT
strategies is discussed in Section IV.C. As in Table 4, the table reports coefficients estimated from Eq. (1) for five performance measures as dependent variables:
Revenues, Returns, Sharpe Ratio, Trading Volume, and Revenues per MSEK Traded. We estimate OLS regressions with month fixed effects. In Panel A, log(Queuing
Latency + 1) is the natural logarithm of Queuing Latency + 1, and, in Panel B, log(Mean Latency), is the natural logarithm of Mean Latency. Top 1 and Top 1-5 are
indicator variables for whether a given firm is ranked among the top 1 or top 1-5 firms by the corresponding latency measure. All other independent variables are as in
Table 4. *, ** and *** correspond to statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm and month and reported in
parentheses. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading (January 2010 to December 2014).

Table 7: Price impact, realized spread and latency
This table examines the relationship between Decision Latency and two dependent variables: active Price
Impact and passive Realized Spread. Price Impact is the basis point change in spread midpoint from just
before to ten seconds after a trade initiated by an HFT firm. Realized Spread is the basis point difference
between the transaction price and the bid-ask spread midpoint ten seconds after a trade where an HFT firm
was the liquidity provider.  Top 1 and Top 1-5 are indicator variables for whether a given firm is ranked
among the top 1 or top 1-5 firms by speed in a given month. Decision Latency, Average End-of-Day
Inventory, Maximum Intraday Inventory, Investment Horizon, and the Aggressive Ratio are defined as in
Table 2. We also control for the following stock-month-specific variables: Volatility, Fragmentation Index,
Tick Size, Quoted Spread (all defined as in Table 1), and Non-HFT Trading Vol., which is the SEK trading
volume recorded by non-HFT brokers. All continuous variables are in units of standard deviations. *, ** and
*** correspond to p-values lower than 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Standard errors are dually clustered by
firm-stock and month and are reported in the parentheses. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60
months of trading (January 2010 to December 2014); stock-firm-month observations for which an HFT firm
does not trade actively or passively are excluded.

Table 8: Cross-market arbitrage and latency

This table reports probit regression estimates corresponding to the probability of initiating a trade (Active Trading; Panel A) or supplying liquidity in a
trade (Passive Trading; Panel B) in the equity markets in response to a change in the futures index price. The dependent variable is 1 when a Fast HFT
firm performs the trade and 0 if a Slow HFT does it. In each month, Slow HFTs are those who are not among the top five HFTs in terms of trading
speed. Fast HFTs are either the top 1 or top 1-5 HFTs in terms of trading speed. Trades included in the analysis are those performed by HFTs in the
sample stocks. A news event is defined as when the absolute return on the OMXS30 futures during a one-second window preceding the stock trade is
“large” (in the top decile for each month among non-zero absolute returns). The variable News is +1 if the active party trades in the direction of the
news, -1 if the active party trades in the opposite direction of the news, and zero if there is no news event in the one-second window before the trade.
We include the following control variables: Lagged Volatility, the average second-by-second squared return (multiplied by 1,000) over the previous ten
seconds; Lagged Volume, the SEK Trading Volume (divided by 100,000) over the previous ten seconds; Quoted Spread, the difference between the best
bid and offer quotes (multiplied by 10,000), divided by the midpoint quote; Depth at BBO, the average number of shares available at the best bid quote
and the best offer quote (divided by 100,000), multiplied by the midpoint quote. Marginal effects are also reported. Regressions are estimated month-
by-month from January 2010 to December 2014; reported coefficients and marginal effects are means across the sixty month, and standard errors are in
parentheses. *, ** and *** correspond to p-values lower than 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 9: Persistence of HFT performance

This table analyzes persistence in HFTs’ performance on both a daily (Panel A) and a monthly (Panel B) frequency. The persistence coefficient reported in
the table is the 𝛽 estimated in the regression model given in Eq. (3), where Performance can be one of the following dependent variables calculated on a
daily basis for each HFT firm: Revenues, Returns, Sharpe Ratio, and Revenues per MSEK Traded  (all defined as in Table 2). For the monthly frequency,
each of the performance measures defined on a daily frequency are first averaged across trading days within each month. The Sharpe Ratio is considered
only for the monthly regressions and is based on mean and standard deviation of daily observations of Revenues. The variables are either in units of
standard deviations for each day or month (in each time period, firm-level performance is centered on the mean and scaled by standard deviation across
HFTs) or on the rank order of the HFTs (from 1 to 16 based on performance). *, ** and *** correspond to p-values lower than 10%, 5%, and 1%,
respectively. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm and day (or month for Panel B) and are reported in parentheses. The sample consists of 25
Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading (January 2010 to December 2014).

Table 10: Long-run trends in HFT concentration and industry-wide performance
This table reports long-run trends in various variables related to the HFT industry. Total Daily Revenues (Average
Daily Revenues) is Revenues summed (averaged) across all HFTs, reported in SEK; Average Revenues per MSEK
Traded is daily Revenues per MSEK Traded aggregated across HFTs; Daily Trading Volume is the daily Trading
Volume summed across HFTs; Cost of HFT Activities for Non-HFTs is HFT Revenues divided by non-HFT
trading  volume.  The  table  also  reports  long-run  trends  in  various  variables  measuring  the  HFT  industry
concentration in terms of revenues and volumes: specifically, the Herfindahl Concentration by Revenues or by
Trading Volumes is calculated as in Eq. (5). All measures are calculated on a daily frequency and reported in
Panel A as the average across the trading days of each half-year period. Standard errors are given in parentheses.
Panel A also reports T, the number of trading days in each half-year period. Panel B reports estimates of
regressions  aimed  at identifying time  trends,  specified  for each variable  observed  at daily frequency. The
regression specification is given in Eq. (4). An estimated 𝛽 > 0 indicates an increasing trend in the dependent
variable. *, ** and *** correspond to p-values lower than 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. In Panel B, Newey-
West standard errors (using 30 day lags) are in parentheses. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60
months of trading (January 2010 to December 2014).

Revenues per MSEK Traded, and Returns are defined as in Table 2 for each HFT firm, stock, and trading day. The
table reports coefficient estimates from Eq. (7), estimated on a panel of firm-stock-day observations. The one-month
dummy takes the value 1 if firm i began trading stock j in the last 30 days, otherwise 0; two- and three-month dummy
variables are defined similarly. We exclude the observations in January 2010 as this is when we first observe any
firm. In the fourth column, a linear probability regression is estimated using Eq. (7) but with the dummy Exit  as the
i,t
dependent variable, which takes the value 1 on day t for firm i if that is the last day firm i trades. This regression
excludes observations in December 2014, the last month of the analysis, since we cannot determine exits. In the fifth
column, an OLS is estimated on a firm-stock-month panel using Eq. (7) but with Decision Latency as the dependent
variable. (Since Decision Latency is a firm-month variable, it is assigned to be constant across stocks). *, ** and ***
correspond to p-values lower than 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm-stock
and month and are reported in the parentheses. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading
(January 2010 to December 2014).

Appendix
A1. TRS data processing
This appendix presents a summary of our data processing. There are on average 8.56 million entries in
each month of the TRS data. Post-processing, the number of observations is on average 6.16 million per month.
(a) Time stamp adjustment
The firms reporting to TRS operate in different time zones and the data base does not have a built
in functionality to adjust the trade times to a common time zone. To adjust the time stamps we record in
which hour the first and last exchange-transaction is executed at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm or at one of
the MTFs for each firm in each day. All the exchanges open at 8 am (GMT) and close at 4:30 pm (GMT).
We adjust the time stamps of firms that do not have their median first and last trades in sync with the
opening hours. For example, for a firm with the median first trade hour in a month being 7 am and the
median last trade hour being 3 pm, we adjust all transaction time stamps by +1 hour.
(b) Matching to TRTH data
TRS transactions are matched to TRTH transactions using information on stock, trading venue,
date, time, price, buy/sell, and quantity. The time stamps of the two databases are allowed to differ by no
more than one second. Where trader IDs are available in the TRTH data (for NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
only), they are added to the matching criterion. TRTH trades are split into two transactions, one for the
buyer and one for the seller. If there are several matches to one transaction, the transaction closest in time
is considered to be the closest match. To the extent that there are multiple TRTH trades in the same
second, same stock, at the same trading venue, with the same price and quantity, and with different sub-
second time stamps, this approach may introduce noise in the time stamps. This potential problem applies
only where trader IDs are unavailable in TRTH, and it is more likely at the most active trading venue, for
example December 2014 at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. For that subset, 6.5 % of all transactions have a
potentially noisy sub-second time stamp. The time stamp noise due to this problem is however unlikely to
influence the Decision Latency, see discussion in footnote 16.
67

(c) Firms
We analyze trading revenues at the corporation level rather than the branch or division level.
Accordingly, we truncate BIC codes (11-letter identifiers of the financial institutions reporting to TRS) to
the first four letters that are unique to each corporation. For various reasons, such as mergers and
acquisitions, the same corporation may span several (truncated) BIC codes. For example, GETCO
acquired Knight Trading in August 2013. We thus treat the (truncated) BIC codes GEEU (GETCO) and
NITE (Knight Trading) as separate for the period preceding the merger and as one corporation for August
2013 onwards.
(d) Filtering of trades
We exclude transactions where the trade price is more than 5% lower than the official low price
of the stock-day, or more than 5% higher than the official high price of the day. The official statistics do
not consider OTC transactions, so prices outside the High-Low interval are possible, but deviations of
more than 5% are considered erroneous. TRS transactions that are flagged as derivative-related either in
TRS or in the TRTH entry that it is matched to are also excluded.
Non-proprietary transactions frequently generate more than one entry in TRS. For example, if a
broker buys 100 shares on behalf of a client, it may be reported as two transactions in TRS: one
transaction where the reporting firm purchases 100 shares at the exchange, and one off-exchange
transaction where the reporting firm sells 100 shares to its client.29 As firms differ in how they report their
transactions we need to process the data to make transactions comparable.
For each transaction we seek to retain one representative TRS entry and to attach an entry of the
end investor associated with that transaction. The end investor assignment is done differently depending
on the type of trade.
29 In a memorandum on transaction reporting FI provides numerous examples on how different types of trades on behalf of
clients may be reported. The memo may be retrieved at
http://www.fi.se/upload/90_English/90_Reporting/TRS/memo_transaction_reporting_ver_1_7_2014-03-07.pdf
68

We define primary transaction as TRS entries where the counterparty of the trade is a clearing
house or the same as the trading venue for the transaction or the owner of the trading venue (in the case
of dark pools). The definition is motivated by the fact that all exchange transactions must be done through
central counterparty (CCP) clearing. All other TRS entries are defined as secondary transactions. Of all
TRS entries, 81.5% are considered primary transactions.
(i) Primary transaction matched to a secondary transaction of the same firm
To account for several entries reported for the same transaction, we match primary and secondary
transactions by reporting firm, stock, price, quantity, date, and time. The time stamps are allowed to
differ by no more than one second. The end investor of primary trades matched in this way is set to the
client of the secondary trade, if available, and otherwise to the counterparty of the secondary trade. The
matched secondary trades are then discarded. Of all primary transactions, 26 % are matched to a
secondary transaction in this way.
(ii) Primary transaction matched to a secondary transaction of another firm
To account for the case that the same transaction is reported by both counterparties, we match the
reporting firm of primary transactions to the counterparty of secondary transactions. The other matching
criteria include stock, price, quantity, date, and time. As above, the time stamps are allowed to differ by
no more than one second. The end investor of primary trades matched in this way is set to the client of the
secondary trade, if available, and otherwise to the reporting firm of the secondary trade. The matched
secondary trades are then discarded. Of all primary transactions, 12 % are matched to a secondary
transaction in this way.
(iii) Primary transaction that is not matched to a secondary transaction
69

Primary transactions that are not matched to a secondary transaction are considered to be on
behalf of a client if a client reference is available, and otherwise proprietary. For client (proprietary)
trades, the end investor is set equal to the client reference (the reporting firm).
(iv) Secondary transaction that is not matched to a secondary transaction
Secondary transactions that are not matched to a primary transaction, are considered to be on
behalf of a client if a client reference is available, and otherwise proprietary. For client (proprietary)
trades, the end investor is set equal to the client reference (the reporting firm).
(v) Secondary transactions where the counterparty does not report to TRS
To capture firms that are not obliged to report to TRS, but that still trade our sample stocks, we
look for firms that are reported as counterparties but that not show up as reporting firms. For all
secondary transactions where such firms appear as counterparties, we create a new entry with the same
properties but with opposite direction of trade and with counterparties reversed. This is a way to detect
HFT firms that connect to the market through direct market access or sponsored access. Of all secondary
transactions, 16 % are subject to this procedure.
A2. HFTs active at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
Appendix Table 1 reports 19 firms identified as HFTs in the sample. Due to confidentiality requirements,
we cannot report the full list of names of the 25 HFTs covered in the proprietary data set. However, in Appendix
Table 1, we use public trading records to report the names of 19 HFTs who trade at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
as members. The HFTs not listed in Appendix Table 1 therefore trade only at other trading venues or as clients of
other members at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm.

A3. Comparison of HFT revenue calculation methods
We compare four methods of calculating trading revenues. As explained in the main text, adjustments are
needed because small data errors in inventory can accumulate over time, leading to large and persistent (unit root)
errors in computing position that can persist indefinitely throughout the sample if left uncorrected. However, this
does not appear to be much of a concern in practice, as shown below (see Appendix Table 2). The four methods
are as follows. No adjustment is calculated by cumulating daily inventory positions over the full sample. Method
1: Benchmark is the method used throughout the paper that zeros the end-of-day position daily for each HFT firm
(equivalent to assuming that each firm liquidates any remaining end-of-day position at the daily closing price).
Method 2: Intraday Revenues assumes a first-in-last-out inventory accounting. That is that any remaining end-of-
day positions were never purchased in the first place. Method 3: Intraday Revenues Plus Revenues from Inventory
Sold is similar to Method 2 but adds back in the revenues from closing end-of-day positions that are in opposite
direction of previous day end-of-day inventory. That is, the end-of-day inventory is marked to market only if an
offsetting position exists in the previous end-of-day inventory.
Appendix Table 2 reports the firm cross-sectional distribution of HFT trading revenues using the four
different methods for calculating trading revenues. It shows that inventory adjustments do not alter the main
results of the paper in the sense that the mean, median, and distribution are roughly similar across the different
methods. As a result, marking-to-market end-of-day inventory positions is relatively innocuous.

A4. Construction of daily Fama-French plus momentum factors for Swedish equities
We construct daily Fama-French and momentum factors for Swedish equities. The dataset used to
construct the factors (using the variables: daily total excess returns, shares outstanding, and quarterly book values)
comes from Compustat Global and covers the period January 2010 to December 2014. We exclude stock-day
observations in which the total market capitalization falls below 100 MSEK (about 10.5 million USD as of the
71

exchange rate of December 2014). The four factors (excess market return, small minus large [SML], value minus
growth [HML], winner minus loser [WML]) are constructed according to the specifications used to create U.S.
factors, as specified on Kenneth French's website: the value-weighted portfolios consist of top-30%, middle 40%,
and bottom-30% of stocks (by market capitalization, book to market, and past-12-month returns for SML, HML
and WML, respectively) and are re-sorted every July 1 using data from the previous year’s performance.
Appendix Table 3 reports summary statistics corresponding to these traded risk factors for Swedish
equities. The statistics include the mean daily log excess return (annualized), its standard error, and the number of
observations (i.e., the number of trading days), and are reported for each portfolio. The annualized excess returns
on the four portfolios (market excess return, SMB, HML, WML) are 0.160, 0.176, 0.039, and 0.028, respectively,
which are all positive, as expected.

A5. Exchange fees, liquidity rebates, and their potential effect on trading performance
Appendix Table 4 reports exchange fees in 2014 for three stock exchanges (NASDAQ OMX Stockholm,
BATS, and Chi-X) trading Swedish equities. Fees range from 0 to 0.325 bps over these selected venues.
Exchange fees depend on the side of the trade: “maker” fees are less than “taker” fees (for example, 0.13 vs. 0.325
bps for NASDAQ OMX S30 stocks), and, at Chi-X, makers receive liquidity rebates (negative fees) of about
0.225 bps. For NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, we report the fees for S30 stocks, which are lower than for other
stocks; all the stocks in our sample fall into this category.
INSERT APPENDIX TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE
While NASDAQ OMX Stockholm grants preferential prices for liquidity provision under its Liquidity
Provider Scheme (LPS), BATS and Chi-X do not (a designated liquidity provider program exists but doesn’t have
72

lower fees). Although BATS and Chi-X merged in November 2011, with technology integration complete by
April 2012, the trading platforms continue to implement different pricing structures.
Appendix Table 5 analyzes HFT performance after accounting for potential maker‐taker fees and liquidity
rebates and shows that even accounting for the most conservative possible fees and/or rebates does not
qualitatively change the results.
INSERT APPENDIX TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE
This table is similar to Table 2 but adjusts for potential maker-taker fees and liquidity rebates. Panel A
reports trading revenues under the assumption of the maximum possible maker-taker fees on NASDAQ OMX
Stockholm (0.325 bps taker fees; 0.125 bps maker fees), and Panel B uses the maximum possible on the Chi-X
exchange, which features a liquidity rebate (0.30 bps taker fees; 0.225 bps liquidity rebate).
Accounting for the most conservative possible fees and/or rebates does not qualitatively change the
results. For example, though trading performance for the entire distribution is shifted down slightly, the sign of
Revenues does not change for any HFT firm. We additionally confirm (not reported in the table) that the
performance results are still positively skewed, with the same HFTs at the top strongly outperforming their
competitors.
A6. Trading performance and latency of the 5 fastest HFTs
Appendix Table 6 is similar to Table 4 but breaks down the Top 1-5 dummy variables into individual
dummy variables for the fastest HFTs: Top 1, Top 2, Top 3, Top 4, and Top 5. It shows that even among the top
five HFTs the faster firm tends to perform better and that performance is monotonic in latency.
INSERT APPENDIX TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE

Appendix Table 1: HFTs active at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
This table shows a list of HFTs who according to public trading records are active at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm
for at least one month of our sample period (January 2010 to December 2014). The list contains 19 of the 25 firms
identified as HFTs in our sample. We can only show the public record for confidentiality reasons. HFTs that are
not listed do not trade as members at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, but may trade at other trading venues or as
clients of other members at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. The HFTs are presented in alphabetical order.

Appendix Table 5: HFT performance after accounting for potential maker-taker fees
This table is similar to Table 2 but adjusts for potential maker-taker fees and liquidity rebates. Panel A reports trading revenues under the
assumption of the maximum possible maker-taker fees on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (0.325 bps taker fees; 0.125 bps maker fees), and Panel B
uses the maximum possible on the Chi-X exchange, which features a liquidity rebate (0.30 bps taker fees; 0.225 bps liquidity rebate).

Appendix Table 6: Trading performance and latency of the 5 fastest HFTs
This table is similar to Table 4 but breaks down the Top 1-5 dummy variables into individual dummy variables for the fastest HFTs: Top 1, Top 2, Top 3, Top 4,
and Top 5. As in Table 4, it reports coefficients estimated from Eq. (1) for five performance measures as dependent variables: Revenues, Returns, Sharpe Ratio,
Trading Volume, and Revenues per MSEK Traded (all defined as in Table 2). We estimate OLS regressions with month fixed effects. The independent variables
considered are as follows: log(Decision Latency) is the natural logarithm of Decision Latency (defined as in Table 2). Top 1, Top 2, Top 3, Top 4, and Top 5 are
indicator variables for whether a given firm is ranked as the top 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 firms by Decision Latency in a given month. The control variables, whose
estimated coefficients are omitted to conserve space, are the same as in Table 4. All continuous independent variables are in units of standard deviations. *, **
and *** correspond to statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Standard errors are dually clustered by firm and month and are reported in
the parentheses. The sample consists of 25 Swedish stocks and 60 months of trading (January 2010 to December 2014).
