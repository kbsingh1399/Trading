## Executive Summary & Core Hypothesis
Momentum strategies are an important part of alternative investments and are at the heart of commodity trading advisors (CTAs). These strategies have, however, been found to have difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in market conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend (downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies are prone to making bad bets. To improve the response to regime change, we introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online changepoint detection (CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1904.04912] pipeline, which uses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping it back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a changepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised changepoints, in a data driven manner. Back-testing our model over the period 1995-2020, the addition of the CPD module leads to an improvement in Sharpe ratio of one-third. The module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity, and in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015-2020) the performance boost is approximately two-thirds. This is interesting as traditional momentum strategies have been underperforming in this period.

## Quantitative Strategy & Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Alpha Signal Generation Mechanism
The strategy generates alpha by identifying systematic structural inefficiencies in market order flow, volatility surfaces, or cross-asset price dynamics. The underlying process assumes:
- State Space Representation / Cointegration Operator:
  Delta S(t) = alpha + beta * F(t-1) + epsilon(t), where epsilon(t) ~ N(0, sigma^2)
- Order Flow Imbalance (OFI):
  I_OFI(t) = Sum [ Delta V_bid(k)(t) - Delta V_ask(k)(t) ] for k = 1 to K
- Risk-Neutral Drift vs Physical Realized Excursion:
  dX(t) = theta * (mu - X(t)) dt + sigma * dW(t)

### 2. Execution & Inventory Control
- Entry Confluence: Requires statistical threshold clearance (Z >= 1.80) under non-zero order flow confirmation.
- Microstructure Slippage Mitigation: Formulated to circumvent toxic adverse selection and front-running via passive queue placement and algorithmic TWAP/VWAP execution slicing.
- Asymmetric Ratchet: Breakeven ratchet armed at +0.8R, locking in structural profits while cutting left-tail risk under empirical Weibull exit boundaries.

## Practical Deployment Guidelines & Real-World Frictions
1. Exchange Frictions: Must clear taker fee barriers (>= 8 bps) and adverse selection slippage (>= 10 bps).
2. Turnover & Capital Constraints: Requires dynamic half-life position sizing to prevent high turnover from destroying alpha edge.
3. Regime Dependence: Active strictly during verified expansion or mean-reverting regimes as identified by volatility and liquidity thresholds.
