Abstract
This paper presents a high-frequency cryptocurrency market dataset obtained by operating a
non-validating blockchain node on Hyperliquid, a limit order book-based decentralised exchange
that is now one of the most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges, handling billions of USD in daily
turnover. Unlike conventional Level 3 data sources such as LOBSTER, our data captures the
complete order placement and cancellation history of all traders—identified pseudonymously through
wallet addresses—including rejected orders and failed cancellation attempts that typically do not
appear in conventional feeds, counterparty identities on both sides of each trade, and inventory
positions after every transaction, all with nanosecond-precision timestamps. We make a portion of
this dataset publicly available on Zenodo (with more available upon request), and discuss potential
applications to market microstructure research.
1. Introduction
Researchers studying market microstructure in general, and limit order books (LOBs) in particu-
lar, currently have limited options for obtaining detailed, high-quality datasets. Most commonly,
existing research utilises databases such as LOBSTER [5], which, although valuable, offer an incom-
plete record of market activity and lack trader identifiers. Alternatively, researchers may negotiate
access to proprietary datasets directly from exchanges or regulators—arrangements that are difficult
to secure and that typically cannot be shared with other researchers wishing to interrogate the
original findings. Commercial market data feeds, while more accessible, are generally not designed
with academic research needs in mind and lack the granularity required for many investigations of
interest.
In this paper we present a dataset of LOB activity obtained from Hyperliquid, a decentralised
cryptocurrency exchange operating entirely on a blockchain. In just a short period, Hyperliquid has
grown into one of the most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges, handling billions of USD in transaction
turnover every day. Hyperliquid records all transactions publicly on a blockchain ledger, making
them, in principle, accessible to anyone, much as for other blockchains such as Bitcoin. However,
the raw transaction stream is large—upwards of 100 GB per day—and converting it into a form

suitable for quantitative analysis requires infrastructure for handling large datasets. We have set up
a non-validating node on the Hyperliquid blockchain and developed a data processing pipeline to
transform the raw transaction stream into a structured, compact dataset suitable for research. We
make a portion of this dataset publicly available on Zenodo, along with documentation and code for
working with the data, to facilitate further research. The resulting dataset provides what Hyperliquid
terms “Level 4” data1—extending the conventional Level 3 granularity with pseudonymous trader
identifiers, rejected order/cancellation attempts, and counterparty information for every trade.
1.1. Comparison with Conventional Data
As noted above, existing datasets such as LOBSTER typically only capture a subset of the
overall order book activity, and even within that subset, they provide incomplete information in a
way which rules out certain investigations of interest. In contrast, our Hyperliquid dataset offers:
• User information attached to each action: Every action is tagged to a user wallet address.
• Full order information: Unlike LOBSTER, where the order type for a trade (such as limit
or market order) is not directly visible, Hyperliquid records all order details, including order
type, time-in-force,2 limit price, size, and all other parameters for each submitted order.
• Failed attempts: We observe not only successful requests but also all failed order attempts
(such as rejected maker orders). The data also captures every cancellation request, including
repeated or unsuccessful attempts.
• Counterparty identification: Each transaction contains the identifiers of both the maker
and the taker counterparties of the trade, along with their starting positions before the trade.
• User-level statistics: From the trade and order data, user-level metrics such as position
sizes, realised profit and loss, and inventory trajectories can be computed for any trader over
any time horizon.
2. Hyperliquid Exchange
Hyperliquid is a decentralised exchange (DEX) built on its own Layer 1 blockchain—a distributed
ledger where transactions are grouped into blocks, cryptographically linked in sequence, and validated
by a network of nodes through a consensus mechanism.3 Hyperliquid employs a purpose-built,
1Hyperliquid distinguishes Level 2 (aggregated depth, available via the public API) from Level 4 (individual
orders with wallet addresses, order IDs, and full parameters, available through a node). In the standard market data
taxonomy, Level 3 denotes individual order events (e.g. LOBSTER). Level 4 extends this with pseudonymous trader
identifiers, rejected order attempts, counterparty information, and pre-trade inventories. See Hyperliquid’s node
documentation: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/nodes/l1-data-schemas.
2A directive that specifies the conditions under which an order remains active and how it may interact with the
book (e.g. post-only, immediate-or-cancel, good-til-cancel).
3Some have questioned Hyperliquid’s degree of decentralisation: the active validator set comprises only 21 nodes,
selected as the operators with the highest staked holdings of the platform’s native token (HYPE). This contrasts with
more permissionless designs such as Bitcoin, where thousands of nodes participate in consensus.

closed-source consensus protocol (HyperBFT) that produces blocks approximately every 100–200 ms—
significantly faster than most other blockchains—enabling throughput sufficient for high-frequency
trading strategies (Hyperliquid claims a capacity of up to 200,000 orders per second).4
Unlike the majority of DEXs—which use so-called “automated market maker” (AMM) designs
(see e.g. [6] and [3])—Hyperliquid operates a fully on-chain LOB, much like those on centralized
exchanges within crypto and other asset classes. Order matching follows standard price-time priority.
We assume familiarity with LOBs; readers seeking an introduction are referred to [4] or other
standard literature.
Unlike traditional exchanges, Hyperliquid requires no account creation or identity verification
for traders. Users simply connect an Ethereum wallet5 to the platform and deposit USDC (the sole
accepted collateral) from the Arbitrum L2 network, with maximum leverage up to 50× depending
on the instrument.
Order Types and Trading Parameters. Hyperliquid provides a suite of order types and
parameters, comparable to those on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance
or Bybit, and similar to those available on traditional venues such as NASDAQ or Euronext. The
complete list is as follows:
• Limit Order: Submits an order at a specified price and quantity; rests on the book if not
marketable.
• Market Order: Executes immediately against the best available liquidity.
• Stop Market: A market order that activates when a trigger price is reached, typically used
to limit losses.
• Stop Limit: A limit order that activates when a trigger price is reached.
• Scale Order: Places multiple limit orders across a specified price range.
• TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) Order: An algorithmic order that slices a large
trade into smaller sub-orders executed at regular intervals.
Additionally, these orders can be modified with the following time-in-force and conditional
parameters:
• Post-Only (ALO - Add Liquidity Only): Ensures the order can only provide liquidity; it
is cancelled if it would cross the spread and take liquidity.
• Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC): Fills any available portion of the order immediately against
resting liquidity and cancels any unfilled remainder.
4On traditional equity venues, trade execution and settlement are often separated: matched trades are forwarded
to a central counterparty such as the DTCC, with final settlement occurring on a T+1 cycle (T+2 in many non-US
markets). On Hyperliquid, matching and settlement are handled by the same on-chain state machine; positions and
margin update atomically within each block, with no clearing intermediary or settlement delay.
5Unlike on centralised exchanges, where traders deposit funds into accounts controlled by the exchange operator,
Hyperliquid users retain custody of their assets through their own cryptographic keys. The exchange can execute
trades against the deposited margin but cannot unilaterally move or misappropriate user funds.

multiple order types (Limit, Market, Stop, TWAP) and time-in-force options.
• Good-Til-Cancel (GTC): The default behaviour where an order rests on the book until it
is either fully filled or explicitly cancelled.
• Reduce-Only: Ensures the order can only reduce an open position, not increase it or open a
new position in the opposite direction.
• Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL): Triggered market orders used to close a position to
realize profits or limit losses, respectively.
Fee Structure and Market Access. Hyperliquid employs a standard fee schedule with
maker-taker fees. Makers pay lower fees than takers, with a baseline of 1.5 basis points (bp) for
makers and 4.5 bp for takers. A VIP tier system offers progressively lower fees based on trading
volume within each individual wallet address. Traders or entities may create and use an unlimited
number of wallet addresses (user IDs); however, fee tiers are determined independently for each
wallet. Therefore, concentrating trading activity into fewer (or a single) wallets typically results in
overall lower fees, compared to spreading volume across multiple wallets with correspondingly higher
fees. The most active traders enjoy rates as low as −0.3 bp (earning a rebate) for maker orders
and 1.44 bp for taker orders. Separately from the maker–taker schedule, all order submissions and

cancellations on Hyperliquid are gasless. Most blockchain transactions—sending Bitcoin or Ethereum
between addresses, interacting with smart contracts, trading on other decentralised exchanges—incur
a per-transaction network fee (commonly termed “gas”). Such a fee in a LOB market would make
high-frequency strategies prohibitively expensive, considering, for example, the high cancel-to-trade
ratios characteristic of many such strategies; conversely, the absence of this cost on Hyperliquid
ensures that high-frequency trading remains structurally viable.
Market participants can interact with Hyperliquid through its web interface or programmatically
via its public API. The API provides WebSocket streams for real-time market data (such as executed
trades and order book updates) and REST endpoints for private order management, facilitating
algorithmic trading strategies and bot development. However, these publicly available WebSocket
streams do not provide a full message-level feed nor include user identifiers (wallet addresses). Thus,
they lack the granularity available by running a node and parsing every blockchain transaction,
which captures all submitted actions in the market—including failed, cancelled, and partially filled
orders—alongside user and action identifiers.
Order Lifecycle. Every order action on Hyperliquid—submission, cancellation, modification,
execution, and rejection—generates a discrete on-chain event, timestamped to nanosecond precision
and permanently linked to the originating wallet address and order identifier. The complete chain
of events for any order can therefore be reconstructed from the data.
Intra-Block Action Ordering. Within each block (produced approximately every 100-200 ms),
Hyperliquid imposes a type-based priority hierarchy: passive orders are processed first, cancellations
second, and taker orders last; within each tier, arrival-time priority applies. The rationale is maker
protection—with cancellations processed before aggressive orders in the same block, market makers
are more likely to be able to cancel stale quotes before being adversely selected, encouraging liquidity
provision.
A distinct but related feature of Hyperliquid’s distributed nature is that arrival time itself is
not uniquely defined. On a centralised exchange, a single matching engine imposes a definitive
ordering on all incoming messages. On Hyperliquid, messages are routed through geographically
distributed validators, one of which is selected pseudorandomly to propose each block; because
different validators may sequence the same pending messages differently, the within-block ordering
reflects the proposer’s local view rather than a globally consistent ordering.
The practical significance of intra-block hierarchy is, however, constrained by the unpredictability
of block assignment. Traders cannot control or reliably predict which block a given message will
land in; two messages sent simultaneously may arrive several blocks apart. A cancellation submitted
milliseconds after an incoming aggressive order may land in an earlier block, causing the cancellation
to execute before the aggressive order even exists on the book. Conversely, a cancellation intended
to pull a stale quote may arrive too late. The extent to which any participant can exploit the
intra-block type hierarchy is therefore bounded by the substantial randomness in message routing.

3. Data
3.1. Node Deployment and Data Collection
Our data were collected by operating a non-validating node on the Hyperliquid blockchain. In
blockchain terminology, a validating node participates in the consensus mechanism that determines
which transactions are accepted into the ledger; a non-validating node synchronises with the network
and maintains a complete local copy of every transaction without participating in consensus. Because
Hyperliquid records every action in its limit order book—submissions, cancellations, executions, and
rejections across all listed instruments—as a blockchain transaction, a non-validating node captures
the complete history of the market’s activity.
Deploying such a node requires no special approval, financial commitment, or blockchain
development experience. One provisions a Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 LTS) meeting the
recommended specification of 16 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM, and a 500 GB SSD from any cloud provider
(e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean), downloads the node binary from Hyperliquid’s repository,6
and starts it with logging flags that control which data streams are written to disk. The complete
deployment is shown below:

logging enabled.

records every change to the visible limit order book.7 On first launch the node replays the chain

history to reach the current block height—a process that typically takes several hours—after which
it writes data to disk in real time. Because the node can generate on the order of 100 GB of raw
logs per day when all data flags are enabled, we recommend attaching at least 2 TB of additional
storage for extended collection periods. During December 2025, the node recorded approximately
880 million order status events per day for the three coins in our sample, with daily volumes ranging
from roughly 730 million on quieter days to over 1.1 billion during periods of elevated activity. Trade
records are orders of magnitude fewer, as each trade corresponds to a single fill event rather than
the many order submissions, cancellations, and rejections that surround it.
3.2. Raw Data Format
We now describe the fields in each of the three data streams introduced above.
3.2.1. Order Status Records
The order status stream records every event for every order submitted to the matching engine.
Each record represents a single event in an order’s history: acceptance onto the book (open), full exe-
cution (filled), cancellation (canceled), or rejection (the most common being badAloPxRejected,
when an Add-Liquidity-Only order would cross the spread; see Albers et al. [1, 2]). Partial fills gen-
erate one or more filled events with decreasing remaining size, optionally followed by a canceled
event for the unfilled remainder. Table 1 lists every field, illustrated with a representative example;
full technical details are provided in SCHEMA.md.

3.2.2. Trade Records
The trade stream records every executed trade across all listed perpetual contracts. Each record
contains the standard fields—price, size, timestamp, and aggressor side—but goes substantially
further: both counterparties are identified by wallet address, along with their respective pre-trade
inventory positions and order identifiers. Those order identifiers allow trades to be linked back to
the order status records described in Section 3.2.1, and, for TWAP executions (see Section 2), a
shared twap_id further links child fills to their parent meta-order. Which of the two counterparties

is the maker and which the taker is determined as follows: when side = A, side_info[0] is the
maker (buyer) and side_info[1] the taker (seller); the roles reverse when side = B. Table 2 lists
every field, illustrated with a complete example including both counterparties.

3.2.3. Raw Book Diff Records
The book diff stream records every change to the visible limit order book. Each record identifies
the user (by wallet address), the order ID, coin, side, price level, and the nature of the change: a new
order placed on the book ("new", with a size field), an order removed ("remove", from cancellation
or full fill), or a size update after a partial fill ("update", with original and remaining size).
Unlike the order status stream, which captures every order attempt—including the approximately
89% that are rejected by the matching engine—the book diff stream records only orders that were
actually accepted onto the book and their subsequent modifications. The oid field links book diff
records to the corresponding order status records, enabling researchers to join the two streams. Full
field-level documentation is provided in SCHEMA.md.

3.3. Compression and Binary Encoding
In its native JSON format, a single order status record occupies approximately 300–450 bytes
depending on field content; at roughly 880 million events per day, this implies an uncompressed daily
total size exceeding 300 GB—well beyond what most analytical workflows or academic repositories
can accommodate. For the public release, we therefore convert the raw order status logs into a
compact binary encoding8 of 54 bytes per record, achieving an 85–88% reduction in file size while
preserving all analytically relevant fields (the transaction hash and client order ID are omitted; see
SCHEMA.md for the complete binary field list). This compression was motivated in part by Zenodo’s
200 GB upload limit, but the more compact representation also allows downstream users to load
and process the data substantially faster than would be possible with the original JSON.
The encoding applies three principal transformations. First, wallet addresses (42-character
hexadecimal strings) are mapped to integer user identifiers via a lookup table (users.csv). Second,
categorical fields—order status, order type, and time-in-force—are encoded as compact unsigned
integer codes via separate lookup tables (statuses.csv, order_types.csv, and tifs.csv). Third,
prices and sizes are packed into fixed-width integers (32-bit) using a custom fixed-point scheme. As
an illustration, Table 3 shows how selected fields from the raw JSON record in Table 1 map to their
binary-encoded counterparts.

The full binary layout and all decoding procedures are documented in SCHEMA.md. The trade data,
which are already sufficiently compact, are retained in their original gzip-compressed JSON format
without binary encoding.
Reader Code. A standalone Python script (read_data.py) is included with the release. It decodes
the binary order status files into pandas DataFrames and loads the JSON trade and book diff records
through a unified interface, allowing a researcher to begin working with the data within minutes of
download.
8A binary encoding stores data as fixed-width numerical values in raw bytes, rather than the variable-length text
strings used by JSON. This eliminates the overhead of field names, quotation marks, and delimiters, and allows
downstream tools to read records at fixed byte offsets without parsing.

4. Data Availability
The dataset accompanying this paper is publicly available on Zenodo under a Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence.9 It comprises three components: (i) order status
records for December 2025, covering the three most liquid perpetual contracts (BTC, ETH, SOL),
stored in the binary encoding described in Section 3.3 and split into six archives by coin and order
outcome (accepted versus rejected, with the latter comprising approximately 89% of all records—to
our knowledge, no other public LOB dataset records failed order attempts); (ii) raw book diff
records for December 2025, capturing every change to the visible limit order book for the same three
contracts in gzip-compressed JSON format, packaged as a single archive; and (iii) trade execution
data for all perpetual contracts from October 2025 through January 2026, in gzip-compressed JSON
format, packaged into four monthly archives (a small number of gaps due to infrastructure restarts
are documented in README.md). December 2025 order status and book diff coverage is complete
with no gaps. Table 4 summarises all released archives.

The total download size is approximately 196 GB. Together, the order status and book diff
streams provide a complete picture of market activity: the former captures every order attempt
(including rejected orders that never reach the book), while the latter records every resulting change
to the visible book state. By processing the book diff records in sequence, one can reconstruct the
full limit order book at any point in time; the order status records add the rich context of rejected
orders, order types, and submission parameters that is invisible in the book itself. Many analyses of
interest—including those in the companion studies by Albers et al. [1] and Albers et al. [2]—operate
directly on the event streams without requiring full book reconstruction. Researchers requiring
additional time periods, reconstructed snapshots, or the raw replica command logs—which record
every user-submitted action together with the matching engine’s response—are invited to contact
the authors. At approximately 880 million order status records per day, the single-month sample
contains roughly 27 billion events; the four months of trade data enable longer-horizon investigations
where event-level order detail is not required.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
We have presented a high-frequency limit order book dataset from Hyperliquid, a large and
rapidly growing decentralised exchange, obtained by operating a non-validating blockchain node.
The dataset captures the complete lifecycle of every order event—including the vast majority that are
rejected by the matching engine—along with counterparty-level trade records and state changes to the
limit order book. A sample of this dataset, along with processing tools, is made publicly available
to facilitate further research. The dataset derived from Hyperliquid offers significantly higher
granularity—particularly including user identifiers and failed order/cancellation attempts—and
transparency compared to conventional public datasets like LOBSTER.
The data enables researchers to investigate a range of questions in market microstructure,
including for instance:
• Rejected Orders: Albers et al. [1] use this dataset to document a massive, previously invisible
flow of rejected post-only limit orders and show that a small cohort of traders uses these orders to
capture queue priority after spread-widening events.
• Price Impact (post-event price changes): Measuring how order flow—including rejected
orders—predicts subsequent price movements. Albers et al. [2] use the rejected-order data in this
dataset to show that orders which never enter the book are nonetheless significantly correlated
with future returns, challenging conventional notions of price impact.
• Latency Races: In a latency race, multiple participants compete to act on the same trading
opportunity—for instance, several takers racing to hit a mispriced quote, or a market maker
racing to cancel before being adversely selected. Conventional data record only the winner; our
dataset records the losers as well, in the form of rejected IOC orders (failed attempts to take
liquidity) and failed cancellations (stale quotes that were not pulled in time), enabling a far more
granular empirical analysis of these competitive scenarios.
• Trader Populations and Market Ecology: Because every order carries a pseudonymous wallet
identifier, the dataset supports classification of the entire trader population into behavioural
archetypes—market makers, directional speculators, arbitrageurs, TWAP executors, and others—
and the study of how these populations interact, compete, and evolve over time. Questions that
are typically confined to proprietary exchange data, such as concentration of activity among a
small number of participants, and the lifecycle of individual trading strategies, become tractable
at the population level.
