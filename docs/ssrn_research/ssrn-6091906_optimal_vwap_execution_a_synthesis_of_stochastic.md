Abstract
The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) execution strategy serves as a fundamental
benchmark and risk-aware tactical tool in institutional trading. Its design integrates
continuous-time stochastic control, microstructure-aware volume forecasting, and adaptive
optimization within a low-latency, closed-loop architecture. This paper synthesizes
contemporary advances in VWAP systems, examining mathematical formulations—from the
Almgren-Chriss framework and CARA utility maximization to dynamic programming and
reinforcement learning—alongside volume prediction techniques ranging from component-
based models (CMEM, SPAR) to machine learning and transformer-based approaches.
Emphasis is placed on the coherent coupling of forecasting, scheduling, and execution layers,
with practical discussion on implementation in live production environments under stochastic
liquidity and evolving market regimes.

Volume Weighted Average Price Strategy (VWAP)
Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is primarily defined as a benchmark and strategic
tool designed to minimize market impact by slicing large orders over a specific time horizon
in proportion to the market's expected (forecasted) trading volume. This form of execution
helps conceal the trader’s intentions, aligns execution with liquidity patterns and thus leads to
reduced transaction costs. The precision of the volume forecasts during VWAP execution
directly translates into the algorithm’s ability to track the benchmark, minimize market
footprint, and ultimately reduce execution costs. VWAP is used as an execution quality
benchmark to provide a neutral and fair measure of execution performance.
Figure 1: Core Concerns of Optimal VWAP Execution
An efficient VWAP execution setup is typically a delicate balance of these concerns and is
fundamentally a dynamic optimization problem shaped by stochastic market evolution,
microstructure frictions, and the need for adaptive, risk-aware control. Effective volume
forecasting combined with precise controls leads to optimal execution of a large order by
achieving the best outcomes (i.e., maximizing P&L or minimizing deviation), benchmarked
against the VWAP.
The success of a VWAP strategy hinges fundamentally on accurate volume ratio predictions,
allowing traders to align execution with the pronounced "U-shaped" pattern of market
liquidity, where activity peaks during the opening and closing hours (Kim et al., 2023, p. 2;
Lee & Park, 2023, p. 2). By precisely forecasting these intraday fluctuations, brokers can
optimally split large parent orders into child orders to minimize transaction costs and slippage

(Cucuringu et al., 2025, p. 1; Tan et al., 2025, p. 2). To navigate complex market dynamics,
modern practitioners employ sophisticated optimization control frameworks, such as
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), which automate the decision-making
process across multiple temporal scales to ensure superior execution (Li et al., 2022, p. 1;
Summary Text, p. 1540). Furthermore, these intelligent systems utilize a continuous
feedback loop to adaptively adjust execution trajectories in real-time, responding
dynamically to evolving market conditions and sudden volatility (Genet, 2025, p. 1; Li et al.,
2022, p. 6).
Realistic VWAP Execution: A Closed Loop Process
Modern VWAP execution systems are typically implemented as a Closed-Loop Pipeline that
integrates volume forecasting, optimization, execution and feedback. Li et al. (2022, pp. 1,
10–11), in their study of VWAP optimization using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)
proposed a Macro-Meta-Micro Trader (M3T) architecture, which captures market patterns
across different temporal scales. The system relies on a workflow where the Meta Trader
and Micro Trader optimize their policies according to feedback rewards received from the
environment, specifically feeding back execution results to allow the system to select new
subgoals based on instant liquidity.
The following setup is applicable to a typical VWAP volume forecasting and optimization
pipeline:

Figure 2: Typical VWAP Execution Setup
VWAP Volume Forecast Layer
The Market Data Feeds define the state dynamics and underlying stochastic processes
governing mid-price evolution, liquidity supply, and market-impact coefficients by capturing
trades, quotes, depth, and exchange events. These raw signals are transformed in the
Preprocessing & Feature Store, where minute-level bins, relative-volume curves, and
cross-sectional microstructure features construct the state vector used by both forecasting and
optimization layers. This preprocessing step discretizes the continuous-time signals into
minute-level state variables—relative volume, volatility, and cross-sectional predictors -
effectively transforming the continuous-time execution problem into a tractable Markovian
representation suitable for Dynamic Programming (DP) or Reinforcement-Learning (RL)
formulations.
VWAP Execution Layer
At the execution layer, the Almgren-Chriss (A-C) model and its extensions provide a
theoretical framework for calculating the profit and loss (Execution Cash Process) and
incorporating risk aversion (CARA utility maximization) into the optimization process. In a
common VWAP execution setup, volume profiles generated by the volume forecast layer
directly inform the allocation strategies of large parent orders and thus connecting the
forecast layer (CMEM, SPAR, statistical, ML, deep learning) with the execution layer
(CARA, cash process, static/dynamic/adaptive schedules) enabling dynamic adaptation to the
changing market conditions.

Schedule Optimization
The Volume Forecast Engine provides the predictive component of the control system,
generating interval-ahead liquidity forecasts that quantify both expected market volume and
its uncertainty. In A-C–style models, this corresponds to estimating the drift and volatility of
the volume process; in RL settings, it defines the transition structure of the environment.
These forecasts feed directly into the Schedule Optimizer, which solves the risk-sensitive
control problem every Δt. Here, CARA-based objectives or mean–variance criteria translate
into a dynamic policy that balances expected slippage against liquidation risk, adjusting
participation rates in response to updated forecasts, inventory levels, and market-impact
constraints.
Execution Engine
The execution engine implements the tactical layer of the policy, converting the optimizer’s
slice into executable child orders. This includes limit-order placement, market-order triggers,
venue routing, and microstructure-aware slicing—effectively the actuator of the control
system. The resulting fill & trade data closes the feedback loop: realized fills update the state,
recalibrate the volume forecast, and trigger re-optimization of the execution trajectory. This
feedback mechanism is essential for stabilizing the control process under stochastic liquidity
and price impact.
Performance & Risk Monitoring Layer
Finally, this layer evaluates the realized control outcomes, tracking slippage relative to
VWAP, participation deviations, and risk-limit adherence. This layer corresponds to the
measurement of the terminal revenue 𝑿𝑻 and the empirical estimation of the utility or reward
function. Its outputs feed back into model calibration, policy evaluation, and long-horizon
improvements to both the forecasting and optimization layers.
These components instantiate a fully integrated execution architecture in which
continuous-time stochastic control, microstructure-aware modelling, and adaptive learning
jointly determine how the system decomposes 𝑋0 into optimal child orders throughout the
trading horizon.
This is precisely the structure envisioned in modern extensions of the A-C framework and
RL-based execution research as noted by Białkowski et al. (2008, pp. 3, 18) who describe
VWAP execution as a loop where, at each new time interval, the broker improves their
forecast of future volume by incorporating the achieved (intraday) past volume to adapt the
remaining strategy.


### Page 6

Cheng et al. (2017, pp. 3, 8, 17) in an extension of the Almgren-Chriss (A-C) model, derive
an optimal scheduled trading rate expressed as a state-feedback law which allows the trader
to adjust the execution rate dynamically based on the current position and evolving market
state. Kim et al. (2023, pp. 3, 5) characterize optimal execution as a stochastic decision-
making process that automates the task of using past data to make execution decisions. Their
dual-level approach uses a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to decide how orders are
executed in each interval based on feedback from public and private state information, such
as the current remaining volume.
Practically, a typical forecasting and schedule optimizer activity can be zoomed in as:

At its core, VWAP execution can be viewed as a continuous-time stochastic control
problem in which a trader must decompose an initial inventory 𝑿𝟎 into a sequence of child
orders that track the evolving market VWAP while mitigating transaction costs, market

impact, and execution risk. This perspective is consistent with Cheng et al. (2017, pp. 1–3),
who emphasize stochastic control and the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation as
foundational tools for characterizing optimal execution policies under uncertainty in both
prices and liquidity. In a similar vein, Guéant et al. (2014, pp. 1–2, 17) formulate the
guaranteed-VWAP liquidation problem as an optimal control task, deriving an HJB partial
differential equation that governs the optimal non-deterministic trading trajectory once
permanent impact, temporary impact, and intraday volume profiles are incorporated into the
cash-flow dynamics. From a market-microstructure standpoint, these formulations capture the
interplay between order-book liquidity, impact kernels, and execution timing that determines
the realized slippage relative to VWAP.
Complementing the continuous-time approach, Kim et al. (2023, pp. 1–4) recast the
execution problem as a sequential decision-making task within a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) framework, using reinforcement learning to automate the stochastic control of trading
intensity. Their model learns a policy that adapts to real-time microstructure conditions—
such as volume fluctuations, fill uncertainty, and short-horizon price dynamics—to accurately
track the cumulative VWAP throughout the trading day.
The market VWAP over a trading horizon [0, 𝑇] is defined as:
VWAP𝑇
market =
∫𝑆𝑡
𝑇
0
𝑑𝑄𝑡
𝑄𝑇
,
where:
• 𝑺𝒕 = instrument price at time 𝑡
• 𝑸𝒕= ∫𝑉𝑠
𝑡
0
𝑑𝑠 is the cumulative market volume
• 𝑽𝒕 (non zero) is instantaneous volume i.e., trading volume at time 𝑡
• 𝑻 = total trading period (typically one day)
• 𝒏 = number of time intervals
If a trader executes at speed 𝑣𝑡≥0 (asset units per unit time), their execution VWAP can be
expressed as:

market.
In discrete form VWAP can be expressed as,
𝑉𝑊𝐴𝑃=

∑

𝑡=1
Summation ensures that the benchmark is a "true" average of daily activity rather than a
simple price average.
Example: If more units traded at $100 than at $101, the $100 price has more influence on the
VWAP.
Figure 4: VWAP Calculation Example
VWAP execution is fundamentally a dynamic optimization problem shaped by competing
forces in a stochastic and microstructure-driven environment. Each decision interval requires
navigating trade-offs between:
-
speed and slippage
-
certainty and adaptability
-
temporary cost and permanent impact, and


### Page 9

-
the classic expected-return versus variance
The Almgren–Chriss (A-C) framework, the execution cash process 𝑿𝑻, and CARA
(Constant Absolute Risk Aversion) utility provide a rigorous mathematical language for
expressing these trade-offs, while modern adaptive algorithms supply the machinery to
respond to real-time market conditions.
Within this setting, Barzykin and Lillo (2019, pp. 1–5, 10) reinterpret the VWAP benchmark
through the perspective of the A-C model, formulating the execution cash process as the
cumulative proceeds from traded quantity net of temporary-impact-driven execution costs.
Their use of a CARA utility functional embeds risk preferences directly into the objective,
transforming the problem into a risk-sensitive control task that accounts for the distribution of
slippage relative to the VWAP benchmark. This aligns with empirical evidence across
execution research showing that risk-aware criteria produce more stable performance under
stochastic intraday volume and liquidity conditions.
Building on this foundation, Li et al. (2022, p. 2) adopt a reinforcement-learning
perspective, treating the A-C structure as the underlying environment that encodes
transaction-cost asymmetries, impact response functions, and risk-aversion parameters. In
their formulation, VWAP execution becomes a sequential decision process in which the
agent learns a policy that adapts participation rates to evolving market microstructure states—
volume fluctuations, fill uncertainty, and short-horizon price dynamics—thereby minimizing
benchmark slippage in a fully data-driven manner. Together, these approaches illustrate how
continuous-time stochastic control, microstructure-aware modelling, and adaptive learning
converge to shape modern VWAP execution systems.
1.2. Almgren-Chriss (A-C) Model
Formally, the A-C model provides the market mechanics that generate the execution cash
process 𝑋𝑇, which in turn becomes the performance metric optimized under CARA utility to
produce a closed-form, risk-aware trading schedule.


### Page 10

Figure 5: Role of Almgren Chriss Model in Optimal Execution
The A-C model assumes:
• Price dynamics:
𝑑𝑆𝑡= 𝜎. 𝑑𝑊𝑡−𝑘. 𝑣𝑡𝑑𝑡
• Temporary impact
𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝: 𝐿(𝑣𝑡) = 𝜂. 𝑣𝑡
2
Price Dynamics in A-C Model
𝑑𝑆𝑡= 𝜎 𝑑𝑊𝑡−𝑘 𝑣𝑡 𝑑𝑡
This stochastic differential equation (SDE) models ”how the asset’s unaffected price
evolves over time”.
Here,
• 𝝈 𝒅𝑾𝒕: Random market fluctuations (Brownian motion).
o 𝜎 = volatility (how “noisy” the price is).
o 𝑊𝑡 = standard Wiener process (captures unpredictable price moves).
• −𝒌 𝒗𝒕 𝒅𝒕: Permanent market impact 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑝𝑐𝑡𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑚 from trading.
o 𝑣𝑡 = trading rate (asset units per unit time).
o 𝑘> 0 = impact coefficient: each traded asset-unit permanently shifts the price
against the trader.
o The minus sign means: if the trader is selling (𝑣𝑡> 0), the price drifts
downward; if buying, it drifts upward.


### Page 11

Measuring Permanent Impact
𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒑𝒄𝒕𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒎 creates a trade-off:
• Trading faster reduces timing risk (less exposure to random price moves).
• But it increases permanent cost, which directly lowers the final execution quality
(since the benchmark VWAP itself may be affected if the trade is large enough).
• In guaranteed VWAP contracts, the broker must hedge this permanent cost—it’s a
real economic liability.
If a large institution buys 1 million units of an asset, other traders may infer that the buyer has
positive private information—so they adjust their valuations upward, pushing the price higher
even after the trade is done.
• The total effect depends on how much a trader has traded so far, not just the
current trading speed.
• Let 𝑋𝑡= ∫𝑣𝑠
𝑡
0
𝑑𝑠 be the cumulative executed volume up to time 𝑡.
• Permanent impact assumes the price drifts by an amount like 𝑘⋅𝑋𝑡 (if linear) or more
generally 𝑓(𝑋𝑡).
Temporary Impact in A-C Model
In real setups, the VWAP scheduler tries to minimize temporary impact while still
executing the full order and tracking VWAP—balancing speed vs. market footprint.
𝐿(𝑣𝑡
𝑉𝑡
)  or 𝐿(𝑣𝑡) = 𝜂𝑣𝑡
2
This represents the immediate transaction cost or instantaneous cost per asset unit traded due
to temporary market impact:
here,
• 𝒗𝒕: the trading rate at time 𝑡 (e.g., units per minute).


### Page 12

12
• 𝑽𝒕: The total market volume rate at time 𝑡 (how much is trading in the whole
market).
•
𝒗𝒕
𝑽𝒕: the participation rate—what fraction of the market’s activity trader is responsible
for.
• 𝑳(⋅): A cost function that maps trading intensity to an instantaneous cost per asset
units (in price units, like dollars or basis points).
• 𝜼> 𝟎: cost coefficient (depends on liquidity, spread, order book depth).
• Quadratic form (𝒗𝒕
𝟐): reflects that trading faster incurs disproportionately higher
costs. e.g. double the trading speed, quadruples the temporary cost.
• This cost is “temporary” because it doesn’t affect future prices - it’s the slippage
trader pays right now to execute.
So:
• 𝑳(
𝒗𝒕
𝑽𝒕) means: “The more of the market volume trader consumes, the higher their per-
unit cost.”
• Sometimes models simplify this to 𝐿(𝑣𝑡), assuming market volume is normalized or
constant.
Thinking of liquidity as a shallow pond, dipping a cup (𝑣𝑡 small) barely disturbs it. Dumping
a bucket (𝑣𝑡 large) creates a splash and leaves a temporary hole—the price trader get
worsens non-linearly.
Measuring Temporary Impact
In VWAP optimization, the total expected cost includes integrating this temporary cost over
time:
Total temporary cost = ∫𝐿
𝑇
0
(𝑣𝑡
𝑉𝑡
) 𝑣𝑡 𝑑𝑡
Essence of A-C Model (Stochastic Optimal Control with Quadratic Costs)
Putting it together, the trader’s problem becomes:


### Page 13

13
Choose a trading schedule 𝑣𝑡 (how fast to trade over time) to minimize total expected cost,
which includes:
• Permanent impact cost (via price drift in 𝑆𝑡),
• Temporary execution cost (𝜂𝑣𝑡
2),
• Risk penalty from price volatility (since 𝑆𝑡 is random).
Because A-C model assumes:
• Linear permanent impact (𝑘𝑣𝑡)
• Quadratic temporary cost (𝜂𝑣𝑡
2)
• Arithmetic Brownian price noise (𝜎𝑑𝑊𝑡)
That forms a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem — one of the few
stochastic control problems with closed-form solutions - a well-studied area with:
• Analytical or semi-analytical solutions (often involving Riccati equations or
hyperbolic functions),
• Clear trade-offs between trading slowly (to reduce temporary cost) vs. trading quickly
(to reduce exposure to price risk).
• allowance for computation of the optimal schedule in real-time without needing brute-
force simulations.
By making these effects explicit and mathematically tractable, this framework lets traders
compute optimal execution schedules that balance cost, impact, and risk—forming the
backbone of modern algorithmic trading systems like VWAP optimizers.
1.3. Execution Cash Process (Cash received by trader up to 𝐓)
Cheng et al. (2017, pp. 4–14) extend the A-C framework by explicitly incorporating order-fill
uncertainty into the liquidation problem, modelling the execution cash process as the trader’s
total P&L composed of the mark-to-market value of residual inventory, realized cash flows
from executed shares, and a terminal block-trade penalty. Their formulation captures the
stochastic nature of execution risk and its direct contribution to the distribution of
liquidation outcomes. In parallel, Guéant and Royer (2014, pp. 1–5, 17, 20) adapt the A-C


### Page 14

14
model to the VWAP-optimization setting by embedding permanent market impact and
nonlinear temporary impact into the cash-flow dynamics, defining the execution cash process
as the cumulative revenue generated from selling shares under instantaneous market-volume
constraints. Together, these formulations emphasize that the execution cash process
determines the realized revenue 𝑿𝑻, which serves as the primary metric for evaluating
execution quality in algorithmic trading.
Figure 6: Role of Execution Cash Process in Optimal Execution
𝑋𝑇= ∫(
𝑇
0
𝑆𝑡−𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝) ⋅𝑣𝑡 𝑑𝑡
This equation defines the total cash a trader receives from selling asset unit (or pays when
buying) over the time interval [0, 𝑇], after accounting for temporary market impact.
here,
• 𝑿𝑻: total cash accumulated by time 𝑇.
• 𝑺𝒕: the unaffected market price at time 𝑡 — i.e., the price that would exist if the trader
weren’t executing orders.
• 𝒗𝒕: the trader’s execution rate at time 𝑡 (asset units per unit time).
• 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒑(𝒗𝒕, 𝑽𝒕): the temporary price slippage caused by trading at rate 𝑣𝑡 in a
market with volume rate 𝑉𝑡.
• (𝑺𝒕−𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒕) is the actual execution price per unit - lower than 𝑆𝑡 when
selling (because the order pushes the price down temporarily).


### Page 15

15
At each instant, trader sells 𝑣𝑡 𝑑𝑡 units at a price slightly worse than 𝑆𝑡, and integrates that
over time to get total cash.
Subtracting the immediate slippage from each trade allows calculation of the net cash inflow,
and that is what is compared against the benchmark.
Why Subtract Temporary Impact? - Temporary impact reflects the immediate cost of
“eating into” the order book — e.g., crossing the spread or depleting liquidity at the best
bid/ask. It’s called temporary because the price typically reverts after the trade (unlike
permanent impact, which shifts the long-term price trend).
Thus, we don’t get the full 𝑆𝑡 per asset unit - we get slightly less (when selling), and this
formula captures that loss.
The more aggressively a trader trades relative to available liquidity (𝑉𝑡), the worse is the fill
price. This equation sums up all the cash trader actually collects, net of those short-term
price deteriorations.
𝐴𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑋𝑇 is central to slippage calculation:
Slippage = 𝑋𝑇−𝑞0 ⋅VWAP𝑇
(where 𝑞0 is total units traded). The goal of optimal VWAP execution is to maximize 𝑋𝑇 (or
minimize negative slippage).
Remember without A-C’s assumptions, 𝑋𝑇 is just an accounting formula. With A-C, it
becomes a stochastic outcome shaped by 𝑣𝑡 control.
Example (discrete approximation)
Suppose over 1 minute:
• 𝑆𝑡= $100
• Trader sells 1,000 units (𝑣𝑡= 1000/min)
• Market volume 𝑉𝑡= 10,000 units/min
• Temporary impact model: 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝= 0.01 ⋅
𝑣𝑡
𝑉𝑡⋅𝑆𝑡= 0.01 ⋅0.1 ⋅100 = $0.10
Then the execution price ≈ $99.90, and cash received ≈ $99,900.


### Page 16

For an effective VWAP schedule, minimizing average slippage isn’t enough; low variance
and penalizing uncertainty (risk aversion) are also desired attributes, which is where CARA
utility maximization plays a significant role.
1.4. Risk-Aware VWAP Schedule Optimization: CARA (Constant
Absolute Risk Aversion) Utility & Mean-Variance
Risk-aware optimization is the process of incorporating risk into the optimization problem.
Smart execution algos don’t just minimize average cost — they account for risk too.
The intuition behind CARA utility is that the trader is not just maximizing cash — they’re
maximizing utility of cash relative to benchmark, penalizing uncertainty.
Figure 7: Role of CARA Utility in Optimal Execution
The application of the A-C framework by Guéant and Royer (2014, pp. 1–5, 17, 20)
demonstrates how indifference pricing within a CARA utility setting can be used to derive
both the optimal execution strategy and the premium a broker must charge to underwrite a
guaranteed VWAP contract. Consistent with this perspective, Cheng et al. (2017, pp. 4–14)
extend the A-C model to incorporate order-fill uncertainty during liquidation, showing that
optimal policies arise from maximizing the expected exponential (CARA) utility of the
terminal P&L. In the strict-liquidation limit, their formulation converges to an adaptive
VWAP-style strategy, highlighting the structural link between risk-sensitive utility
maximization and benchmark-driven execution.
Implicitly, the risk aversion in VWAP execution contexts can be specified via:
• Max participation rate (e.g., “never exceed 30% of volume”)
• Urgency (e.g., “finish by 3:30 PM no matter what”)


### Page 17

17
• Volatility scaling (e.g., “slow down if volatility > 2x average”)
Mathematically, CARA utility is defined as,
max
𝑣⋅ 𝔼[−exp(−𝛾(𝑋𝑇−𝑞0 ⋅VWAP𝑇))]
or
max
𝑣⋅ 𝔼[−exp(−𝛾⋅Slippage)]
here,
• 𝒗⋅: The entire trading schedule—i.e., the choice of how fast to trade at every moment
from time 0 to 𝑇. This is the control variable we’re optimizing.
• 𝑿𝑻: Total cash received from trading 𝑞0 asset units by time 𝑇, after accounting for
market impact (as defined in the earlier “execution cash process”).
• 𝒒𝟎⋅𝐕𝐖𝐀𝐏𝑻: The benchmark value—what the order would be worth if executed
perfectly at the market’s VWAP.
• 𝑿𝑻−𝒒𝟎⋅𝐕𝐖𝐀𝐏𝑻: This is the slippage (or implementation shortfall).
o If positive → trader did better than VWAP (good when selling).
o If negative → trader underperformed VWAP (bad).
• 𝜸> 𝟎: Coefficient of absolute risk aversion. Larger 𝛾 = more risk-averse.
• −𝐞𝐱𝐩(−𝜸⋅Slippage): This is the CARA utility function (Constant Absolute Risk
Aversion), commonly used in finance because it penalizes losses more than it rewards
gains and has nice analytical properties.
• 𝔼[⋅]: Expectation over all possible market paths (e.g., price volatility, volume
randomness).
Key Observations:
• A naive strategy might minimize 𝔼[𝑞0 ⋅VWAP𝑇−𝑋𝑇] (i.e., average cost).
• But this ignores risk: sometimes traders might get very bad outcomes due to volatility
or volume surprises.
• The CARA utility penalizes variability in slippage. Even if two strategies have the
same average slippage, the one with higher variance will have lower expected utility.

That effectively balances expected performance against uncertainty—exactly what a
prudent institutional broker should do.
Connection to Mean–Variance
In the baseline A-C formulation, the objective is to minimize expected execution cost, but in
a stochastic market environment this expectation-only criterion leaves the Execution Layer
vulnerable to adverse price paths and liquidity shocks. Introducing CARA preferences
transforms the problem into a risk-sensitive optimization, allowing the execution policy to
internalize uncertainty in both price dynamics and market impact. This corresponds to
shifting the Schedule Optimizer (refer to Figure 2) from a deterministic cost-minimizer to a
controller that explicitly balances expected slippage against liquidation risk, using inputs
from the Forecast Layer to modulate participation rates in real time.
This risk-aware perspective is echoed in the GKAC framework, where Skachkov (2013, pp.
3–5, 15) applies calculus of variations to derive optimal liquidation trajectories under a
mean–variance utility functional. In system terms, the expected-return component maps
naturally to the execution cash process generated by the algorithm/slicer, while the variance
penalty aligns with the role of the Performance & Risk Monitoring module, which
quantifies uncertainty in realized revenue and feeds this information back into the control
loop. The resulting trajectory effectively becomes a VWAP-style schedule that is
continuously adjusted based on forecasted volume, market-impact conditions, and real-time
state updates.
Mathematically, under the assumption that slippage is normally distributed (Gaussian),
maximizing this CARA utility is equivalent to solving:
min
𝑣⋅ 𝔼[slippage]
⏟
expected cost
+ 𝛾
2 Var(slippage)
⏟
risk penalty
Therefore, minimizing average slippage plus applying a penalty proportional to its variance
(scaled by risk aversion 𝛾).
Implications:
Old A-C model (Cost Min) New A-C model (CARA Utility Max)
Minimize avg. slippage
Minimize avg. slippage + risk penalty

Old A-C model (Cost Min) New A-C model (CARA Utility Max)
Ignores variance
Penalizes variance via 𝛾
Schedule = fixed curve
Schedule = depends on 𝛾, 𝜎
This means:
• Optimal schedule can be computed in real-time — no simulations or waiting is
required.
• The solution explicitly shows how 𝛾 (risk aversion), 𝜎 (volatility), 𝑘 (permanent
impact), and 𝜂 (temporary cost) trade off against each other.
• The approach provides analytical sensitivity — e.g., “If volatility doubles, front-load
15% more.”
Why This Matters in VWAP Execution?
Because market conditions are uncertain: future prices (𝑆𝑡) and volumes (𝑉𝑡) are random and
a purely deterministic schedule (e.g., static VWAP) might look good on average but fail
badly on volatile days, the CARA objective leads to adaptive, robust strategies that:
• Trade more aggressively when liquidity is high (lower impact),
• Slow down when markets are thin or volatile (to avoid large slippage spikes).
This form of variation in trading activity is heavily dependent on the precision of intra-day
market volume forecasting. Accurate volume forecasting is the most critical input for any
successful VWAP execution strategy. Because a VWAP algorithm’s primary objective is to
participate in the market in proportion to its activity, a reliable prediction of the day’s volume
curve directly informs the ideal trading schedule.
Volume forecasting methods, such as the Component Multiplicative Error Model (CMEM)
and the Separated Periodic Autoregressive (SPAR) model, are integral parts of the optimal
execution problem, providing the essential input for sophisticated frameworks like the
Almgren-Chriss (AC) model and deep learning architectures that optimize the resulting
execution cash process (Profit and Loss or P&L). Such techniques predict the distribution of
trading activity, which is crucial for determining the optimal schedule of child orders.
Emphasizing the significance of volume forecasting, Białkowski et al. (2008, pp. 1–3, 17–18)
argue that the only variable required to track the VWAP benchmark is the intraday volume

shape, as predicting the price itself is not necessary for successful replication. They propose a
methodology that decomposes volume into a common market component and a stock-specific
component, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to remove seasonal variations
without imposing a fixed parametric form. Their research demonstrates that identifying these
components allows for dynamically updated predictions that significantly lower the risk of
failing to meet the benchmark.
In their study of U-shaped intra-day volume pattern, Kim et al. (2023, pp. 1, 3, 5–6) leverage
the pattern to distribute orders accurately over a full-day horizon thus proposing a dual-level
architecture where a "U-shape Transformer" model is specifically designed to capture day-
to-day variations in global daily volume distributions. They suggest that capturing these
global volume oscillations is essential because variations in financial data are often
insignificant within shorter trading windows, making standard forecasting difficult.
Characteristics of U-shaped Intra-day Volume Pattern:
1. High Opening Volume: Information accumulated overnight creates trading pressure
2. Mid-Day Lull: e.g., reduced activity during 10:00 AM - 2:30 PM
3. Closing Surge: Portfolio rebalancing and auction participation
The intraday volume can be decomposed as:

The interesting research performed by Mitchell et al. (2013, pp. 1–4, 15–17) provides an
optimal dynamic solution that depends on the correlation between stock returns and trading
volume, as well as the expected volume itself. They develop a cross-sectional model of
volume that incorporates shape factors, day-of-the-week effects, and autocorrelation
(intraday and overnight). They note that intervals with high expected volume have a
disproportionate impact on VWAP calculation, necessitating highly accurate forecasting in
those specific periods.
2. VWAP Volume Forecasting Methods
Accurate volume forecasting is critical for VWAP execution and various approaches fall into
volume decomposition schemes, statistical and machine leaning methods and more recently
deep learning techniques.
2.1 Volume Decomposition Approaches for Forecasting
Strategies have been developed to explicitly model and separate the deterministic periodic
component of volume from the random fluctuations. Component Multiplicative Error
Model (CMEM) and Separated Periodic Autoregressive (SPAR) models are two such
popular approaches.
CMEM explicitly models the periodic component of volume while SPAR treats intraday
periodicity as a time-of-day fixed effect, allowing for consistent estimation of the underlying
stationary dynamics, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy.
2.1.1 Component Multiplicative Error Model (CMEM)
CMEM is studied in the volume forecasting research performed by Cucuringu et al. (2025, pp.
268, 275–276, 290–291, 326). They utilize CMEM as a primary decomposition framework,
which breaks volume into three components:
-
a daily component (day-to-day trends),
-
an intraday periodic component (time-of-day patterns),
-
and an intraday non-periodic component (autocorrelated dynamics).


### Page 22

22
The study also references STL decomposition, wavelet decomposition, and the Additive
Error Model, which uses simultaneous cross-sectional and time-series data to articulate the
intraday U-shape. Feature importance analysis in this study confirms that these
decomposition components are the most influential predictors for machine learning-based
forecasting models.
CMEM is a multiplicative error model that explicitly models the periodic component of
volume.
Figure 9: CMEM Volume Decomposition Workflow
𝑥𝑡,𝑗= 𝜂𝑡⋅𝑠𝑗⋅𝜇𝑡,𝑗⋅𝜖𝑡,𝑗
Component Details:
1. Daily Component (𝜂𝑡): 𝜂𝑡 captures day-to-day persistence
Example: If Monday had high volume (𝜂𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑦= 1.2), Tuesday might also see elevated
volume (𝜂𝑡𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑑𝑎𝑦= 1.15)
Follows autoregressive structure:


### Page 23

23
𝜂𝑡= 𝜔+ 𝛼· 𝜂𝑡−1 + 𝛽· 𝜀𝑡−1
2. Intraday Periodic Component (𝑠𝑗): 𝑠𝑗 represents the U-shape pattern
Example time-of-day multipliers: 9:30-10:00 AM: 𝑠1 = 1.8 (80% above average) 12:00-
12:30 PM: 𝑠15 = 0.6 (40% below average) 3:30-4:00 PM: 𝑠26 = 2.2 (120% above average)
3. Intraday Dynamic Component (𝜇𝑡,𝑗): 𝜇𝑡,𝑗 captures short-term autocorrelation
If volume in previous interval was high, current interval likely also elevated:
𝜇𝑡,𝑗= 𝜔𝜇+ 𝛼𝜇· (𝑥𝑡,𝑗−1/(𝜂𝑡· 𝑠𝑗−1)) + 𝛽𝜇· 𝜇𝑡,𝑗−1
CMEM Forecasting Process:
Forecast: 𝑥̂𝑡,𝑗= 𝜂̂𝑡× ŝ𝑗× 𝜇̂𝑡,𝑗
CMEM captures the fundamental volume dynamics, allows interpretable components and is
computationally efficient. But is statistically Univariate (ignores cross-stock information),
requires positivity constraints and has limited predictive power (R² ≈ 0.265).
2.1.2 Separated Periodic Autoregressive (SPAR) Model
SPAR is another volume decomposition method designed for forecasting intraday trading
volume by addressing the critical challenge of pronounced periodicity in financial markets.
SPAR model is the focus of research by Tan et al. (2025, pp. 117, 121, 125, 137–138, 145)
which treats intraday periodicity as a time-of-day fixed effect. The method uses a within-
transformation technique to remove the deterministic periodic component, resulting in a
stationary series that can be modelled via standard autoregressive frameworks.
This approach contrasts with the CMEM model, which requires the functional form of the
periodic component (like splines) to be specified ex ante. The within-transformation is
specifically designed to isolate predictable patterns from the more random daily fluctuations
in trading volume. By treating intraday periodicity as a time-of-day fixed effect, the model
isolates predictable patterns from random daily fluctuations. Applying these forecasts to a
dynamic replication strategy substantially reduces tracking error and lowers transaction costs.


### Page 24

24
The core principle of the SPAR is to explicitly separate the volume data into two distinct
components to simplify the forecasting task:
1. A deterministic periodic component: This captures the predictable, systematic
fluctuations of trading volume that occur throughout the trading day, such as the
widely known U-shaped pattern. SPAR treats this intraday periodicity as a time-of-
day fixed effect.
2. A stationary component: This remaining component represents the unpredictable,
dynamic fluctuations in volume after the deterministic periodicity has been removed.
SPAR extends decomposition methods by explicitly isolating the deterministic periodic
component of volume, treating it as a time-of-day fixed effect that is removed through
within-transformation. This separation allows for more accurate forecasting of the underlying
stationary dynamics. Empirically, applying SPAR forecasts to dynamic VWAP replication
strategies reduces tracking error and enhances algorithmic execution efficiency,
demonstrating the economic significance of precise volume decomposition.
How Decomposition Works in SPAR?
The method achieves separation through a technique called within-transformation (or
demeaning), which eliminates the periodic component from the data prior to estimation. This
removal allows for consistent and efficient parameter estimation of the underlying stationary
dynamics using a standard autoregressive framework.
Compared to CMEM
This decomposition approach relates to established methods like the CMEM, which also
decomposes volume into periodic and non-periodic components. While CMEM often
requires specifying the functional form of the periodic component (e.g., a U-shape modeled
by splines), SPAR treats the periodic component nonparametrically as a fixed effect, which
is removed using the robust within-transformation method. This difference helps SPAR avoid
the risk of model misspecification when the actual periodic shape deviates from a chosen
parametric form, such as J-shaped or W-shaped curves observed in various markets.


### Page 25

Figure 10: SPAR Volume Decomposition Workflow
SPAR Methodology
1. Treating Periodicity as a Fixed Effect: Instead of attempting to model the complex,
specific shape of the intraday volume curve (like the known U-shaped pattern), the
SPAR model treats the intraday periodicity as a time-of-day fixed effect. This re-
conceptualization allows for a unified and robust approach to handling different
intraday patterns observed across various assets, such as U-shaped or J-shaped curves.
2. Periodicity Separation via Within-Transformation: The crucial mathematical step
is the within-transformation (or demeaning). This standard panel data technique
eliminates the periodic component before estimation. This process involves
calculating the cross-day mean for each time-of-day interval and then subtracting this
mean from the raw data to isolate the non-periodic, stationary series.
• For a process 𝑍𝑡,𝑘 (e.g., log trading volume) indexed by day 𝑡 and time interval 𝑘, the
within-transformation yields the demeaned series 𝑍̈𝑡,𝑘= 𝑍𝑡,𝑘−𝑍‾𝑡,𝑘, where 𝑍‾𝑡,𝑘 is the
cross-day mean over a moving window 𝑊.
• Since the periodic fixed effect (𝑓𝑘) does not vary by day, applying the within-
transformation removes it (𝑓̈𝑘= 0), allowing the model to consistently estimate the
remaining underlying stationary dynamics.
3. Modeling the Stationary Component (Autoregressive): Once the periodic
component is removed, the remaining stationary series (𝑦̈𝑡,𝑘) can be effectively


### Page 26

26
modeled using a standard autoregressive framework. This is typically formulated as
a panel data regression:
𝑦̈𝑡,𝑘= 𝑋̈𝑡,𝑘−1𝛽+ 𝑢̈ 𝑡,𝑘
where 𝑋̈ represents the demeaned predictors (features) and 𝛽 is the vector of
coefficients estimated, usually via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) on the transformed
data.
4. Forecast Construction and Interpretation: The final one-step-ahead forecast (𝑦̂𝑡+1)
is then constructed by combining the model’s output on the demeaned components
with the estimated periodic component, recovered by taking the average of the
observed data (𝑦‾𝑡,𝑘) and adjusting for the mean of the features multiplied by the
estimated coefficient 𝛽̂. This process ensures the forecast incorporates both the time-
of-day fixed effect and the recent dynamics.
The SPAR framework offers significant practical and analytical benefits:
• Model-Agnostic Preprocessing: SPAR acts as a data preprocessing technique that
can be integrated with various forecasting methods, including OLS, Lasso, Ridge, and
Random Forest, consistently enhancing predictive accuracy across these models
compared to their unadjusted counterparts.
• Enhanced Predictive Accuracy: Empirical results show that SPAR models
significantly outperform standard benchmarks, including the sophisticated Kalman
Filter (KF) model and non-regularized OLS models, because the method explicitly
accounts for intraday periodicity.
• Structural Analysis: SPAR provides an explicit, interpretable estimate of the
intraday periodic curve conditional on explanatory variables. Factor analysis
conducted on these estimated curves revealed that volume patterns are fundamentally
driven by two common factors: a U-shaped curve and a morning-versus-afternoon
asymmetry.
• Economic Significance: Applying SPAR forecasts to a dynamic VWAP replication
strategy demonstrated substantial economic value by reducing tracking error and
enhancing algorithmic execution efficiency.


### Page 27

27
The SPAR model effectively separates the complex, deterministic historical patterns from the
random, predictable fluctuations, resulting in a cleaner signal for time-series forecasting. The
central mechanism, the within-transformation, removes 𝑓(𝑘) to model only the stationary
portion 𝐷, ensuring the predictive model 𝐸 estimates dynamics untainted by the fixed, daily
seasonal pattern. The removed periodic component 𝐶 is then added back to construct the
complete forecast 𝐺.
The core idea of the SPAR model is to simplify the forecasting task by explicitly separating
the volume data into two distinct components: a deterministic periodic component and a
stationary component.
SPAR decomposition is leveraged as a preprocessing step that enhances predictive accuracy
across various statistical and machine learning algorithms.
2.2 Statistical Approaches for Volume Forecasting
Referring back to Figure 2, in the Preprocessing & Feature Store, the earliest
approaches—such as the Rolling Mean—provide a naive yet surprisingly robust baseline,
capturing the stable intraday seasonality that dominates many volume curves. Classical
time-series models like ARMA introduce short-horizon dynamics while remaining
analytically tractable, and CMEM extends this lineage by combining deterministic intraday
profiles with multiplicative stochastic components grounded in economic microstructure.
These models align naturally with a continuous-time view of liquidity as a stochastic process
with both predictable and random components.
2.2.1. Rolling Mean (RM)
Rolling mean is a simple statistical approach, and there are no parameters to estimate, is
robust to model misspecifications, it captures intraday seasonality implicitly since it’s always
comparing like-with-like (same clock time), it captures the U-shaped intra-day volume
pattern.
• Ignores day-to-day shifts: if today is an earnings day or a market crash, the past 5
days won’t reflect that.


### Page 28

28
• No adaptation within the day: can’t react to morning volume surprises when
forecasting afternoon buckets.
Lags structural changes: if market microstructure evolves (e.g., new ETF flows), the rolling
window may be slow to adapt.
Rolling mean averages same interval over past D days
𝑥̂𝑡,𝑗= (1/𝐷)Σ𝑑=1
𝐷
𝑥𝑡−𝑑,𝑗
For instance,
• By predicting volume in interval 𝑗 (e.g., 10:00–10:15 AM) on today (𝑡).
• Instead of modeling complex dynamics, it simply takes the average volume observed
in that same time interval over the past 𝐷 days.
• e.g., If 𝐷= 5, it averages the 10:00–10:15 AM volume from the last 5 trading days.
• e.g., to forecast 10:00-10:15 AM volume on Friday, average the 10:00-10:15 AM
volume from previous 5 days
2.2.2. ARMA Models (Autoregressive Moving Average)
ARMA offers short-term autocorrelation e.g., if volume was higher than usual at 10:00 AM,
it’s likely also elevated at 10:15 AM. Shocks (𝜀) fade over time due to mean-reversion.
ARMA is more adaptive than Rolling Mean— it can respond to recent deviations. But it
assumes stationarity after de-seasonalizing (may not hold on volatile days), it doesn’t model
cross-interval or cross-asset dynamics, and requires careful estimation of 𝜙, 𝜃, and the
seasonal baseline.
ARMA here is applied within each interval across days (not across intervals within a day),
unless extended to a vector form.
ARMA models residuals after removing seasonal patterns
𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑡,𝑗= 𝑥𝑡,𝑗−𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑗
Fit: 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑡,𝑗= 𝜑· 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑡,𝑗−1 + 𝜃· 𝜀𝑡,𝑗−1 + 𝜀𝑡,𝑗


### Page 29

29
It’s a two-step process:
Step 1: Remove seasonal pattern
First, subtract a fixed intraday profile (like the 𝑠𝑗 from CMEM):
Residual𝑡,𝑗= 𝑥𝑡,𝑗−seasonal𝑗
Here, seasonal𝑗 could be the long-run average volume for interval 𝑗 (e.g., from historical
data).
This isolates the “unexpected” part of volume on day 𝑡 in interval 𝑗.
Step 2: Model residuals with ARMA
Fit a time-series model to these residuals:
Residual𝑡,𝑗= 𝜙⋅Residual𝑡,𝑗−1 + 𝜃⋅𝜀𝑡,𝑗−1 + 𝜀𝑡,𝑗
• AR (Autoregressive) term: 𝜙⋅Residual𝑡,𝑗−1
→ Today’s deviation depends on yesterday’s (or last interval’s) deviation.
• MA (Moving Average) term: 𝜃⋅𝜀𝑡,𝑗−1
→ Accounts for short-term shock persistence (e.g., a surprise news event affecting
multiple intervals).

Modern ML and Transformer-based forecasters, integrated into the Volume Forecast

quantification. Their ability to ingest richer microstructure features—order-book imbalance,
volatility bursts, event-driven liquidity shocks—allows the system to anticipate


### Page 30

high-variability regimes that classical models struggle to capture. Yet, in practice, many
production architectures still retain the Rolling Mean as a fallback model, ensuring stability
when ML components fail or encounter out-of-distribution conditions.
The academic debate mirrors this architectural layering. Lee et al. (2023, p. 18) note that
much of the historical literature relied on statistical models such as ARMA and GARCH,
which are well-suited to the stylized statistical properties of intraday volume curves but may
lack the contextual awareness needed to forecast extreme volume ratios. This limitation
becomes particularly relevant for the Schedule Optimizer, whose control decisions depend
critically on accurate forecasts of liquidity and its variance.
A contrasting view is offered by Białkowski et al. (2008, pp. 9, 25), who apply an ARMA(1,1)
model to the “specific” component of intraday volume after removing the common market
factor. Their findings suggest that simple time-series models can still deliver highly accurate
forecasts, materially reducing the execution risk associated with tracking the VWAP
benchmark. In system terms, this reinforces the value of maintaining lightweight,
interpretable models within the Volume Forecast Engine, especially for stabilizing the
control loop when microstructure conditions are benign.
These perspectives highlight that volume forecasting is not a single model but a layered
forecasting stack:
-
statistical baselines for robustness,
-
econometric models for structure,
-
and ML architectures for nonlinear microstructure adaptation.
This layered design ensures that the downstream Schedule Optimizer, Execution Engine,
and Performance & Risk Monitor (refer to Figure 2) operate on forecasts that are both
stable and responsive to the stochastic nature of real-world liquidity.
2.3 Machine Learning (ML) Approaches for Volume Forecasting
Treating VWAP optimal execution as a sequential decision-making task, the ML models
automate the decision process using historical data, enabling strategies to dynamically adapt
to market conditions and capture complex microstructure features. Additionally, Deep


### Page 31

Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques have gained traction as they manage high-
dimensional data and market complexity without relying on strict market assumptions.
In practice, volume decomposition methods like Separated Periodic Autoregressive (SPAR)
are integrated with regularized statistical methods as a highly effective approach for VWAP
volume forecasting.
A study performed by Tan et al. (2025, pp. 3, 11–12, 14) proposes that the decomposition
based Separated Periodic Autoregressive (SPAR) method can be modelled via standard
autoregressive frameworks. The authors demonstrate the "universal effectiveness" of their
framework by integrating it with various models, including Lasso and Ridge regression.
They use specific mathematical formulations for Lasso to promote model sparsity through
coefficient shrinkage and Ridge regression to reduce variance caused by multicollinearity.
2.3.1. The Core Problem

where:
• y = volume to be predicted
• x = features (historical data, autocorrelation, volatility)
• β = regression coefficients (what we’re solving for)
• λ = regularization strength (higher λ = stronger penalty)

Lasso Characteristic: Automatic Feature Selection
• The L1 penalty forces coefficients to exactly zero when they’re not important enough
to justify the penalty cost.
• The 𝜆 penalty shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero
• Performs automatic feature selection
• Prevents overfitting when many correlated predictors exist

Key Characteristic: Stability Through Shrinkage
• The L2 penalty shrinks all coefficients toward zero but never forces them to
exactly zero.
• Shrinks all coefficients toward zero (but not exactly to zero)
• Handles multicollinearity well
• More stable when predictors are correlated
Example: Same features with multicollinearity:

2.3.2. Linear Models with Regularization - Why Regularization
(Constrained Optimization) Matters?
When forecasting intraday trading volume using models like SPAR (Separated Periodic
Autoregressive), we face two critical challenges:
1. Multicollinearity - features like buy notional value, sell notional value, and traded
amount are highly correlated
2. High-dimensional data - many predictors (lags, volatility indicators, time features)
relative to observations
How Regularization Helps in Volume Forecasting?
1. Autocorrelation Features - many lags create multicollinearity
2. Market Indicators - volatility measures often correlate with each other


### Page 35

35
3. Auxiliary Predictors - buy notional, sell notional, traded amount overlap
4. Sample Size - limited historical data relative to features
Lasso and Ridge regression add “penalties” to control model complexity and improve
stability. e.g., use Lasso when testing 50 technical indicators to predict volume, expecting
only 5-10 matter and use Ridge when using buy/sell flows, notional values, and traded
amounts (all related and should all contribute).
2.3.3. Lasso and Ridge in Volume Forecasting
Tan et al. (2025, pp. 3, 11–12, 14–16, 34–35) emphasize the "universal effectiveness" of
SPAR framework by integrating it with various linear models, specifically naming the
Lasso-SPAR (LASP) and Ridge-SPAR (RISP) variants e.g.,
◦ LASP (Lasso-SPAR): applies Lasso regression to the SPAR within-transformed data,
which allows for automatic feature selection and model sparsity while accounting for
periodicity. It integrates L1 regularization with periodic decomposition and automatically
selects relevant time periods and lags. LASP is best when there are many potential predictors,
but only some are truly predictive.
◦ RISP (Ridge-SPAR): utilizes Ridge regression to address multicollinearity in volume-
related independent variables after the periodic component has been separated. It integrates
L2 regularization with periodic decomposition and stabilizes estimates when volume drivers
are correlated. RISP is best when buy/sell flows, notional values, and amounts move together.
The research demonstrates that LASP and RISP consistently outperform their unadjusted
counterparts (standard Lasso and Ridge models) in terms of out-of-sample and error control
metrics like RMSE and RMAE across various trading volume regimes. Comprehensive
asset-level results for LASP and RISP across high, medium, and low-volume stocks are
detailed in the study's performance tables and appendix.

2.3.4 Non-Linear Models with Regularization - XGBoost (Gradient Boosted
Trees)
Figure 13: Regularization Process In XgBoost
Unlike Lasso, and Ridge regression, which are linear models with built-in shrinkage,
gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost are nonlinear ensemble learners that perform
implicit feature selection through their tree-building process. They differ significantly in their
approach to feature selection, regularization, and model complexity. important features
through tree construction.
All three are supervised learning methods and aim to predict future volume (target variable)
given historical data (time of day, past volume, volatility, order flow, etc.) and learn patterns
to forecast the next value. While Lasso/Ridge attempt to fit a straight line, but punish big
coefficients, XGBoost focuses on building many decision trees, each correcting the last one’s
mistakes. It thrives in volume forecasting because:
-
Non-linear nature of Volume forecasting – it depends on complex interactions e.g.,
volume spikes at market open (time-of-day effect), surges when volatility jumps and
index futures roll (interaction effect), and decays after lunch unless news hits
(conditional pattern). Linear models like Lasso/Ridge struggle here because they
assume additive, linear relationships.
-
Captures Nonlinearities - trees naturally model thresholds e.g., “If volatility > 2%
AND time < 10:30 AM then predict high volume”


### Page 37

37
-
Handles Interactions Automatically – there is no need to manually create volatility
× time-of-day features, the tree finds them via splits.
-
Robust to Irrelevant Features - if a feature (e.g., news sentiment) doesn’t help
reduce error, trees just won’t split on it (implicit feature selection).
-
Adapts to Regime Shifts – during market microstructure changes (e.g. new ETF
flows), XGBoost can adapt if retrained unlike rigid linear assumptions.
In context of volume forecasting, decision-tree-based ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost) are
studied in research by Cucuringu et al. (2025, pp. 12–13, 17–18, 36). This study leverages
gradient boosting to capture the complex, non-linear relationships and predictor interactions
inherent in market dynamics. The authors utilize XGBoost across three training schemes:
Single Asset (SAM), Clustered Asset (CAM), and Universal Asset (UAM). Their empirical
results demonstrate that:
◦ Universal modelling significantly boosts XGBoost performance, with its out-of-sample
increasing from 0.532 (SAM) to 0.622 (UAM).
◦ The model is used for feature importance analysis, employing a "weight" metric to
quantify how frequently specific features are used to split data across the ensemble.
◦ The study incorporates Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) predictors into the XGBoost
framework, finding that absolute-magnitude OFI features are more robust for volume
prediction than directional cues, improving performance by 2.8 basis points in nonlinear
settings.
2.4 Deep Learning Techniques for Volume Forecasting
Deep-learning approaches for VWAP volume forecasting are often integrated into
hierarchical or specialized neural architectures. They highlight a paradigm shift toward
dynamic volume estimation, where volume patterns are separated into broader market
evolutions and specific asset class patterns to handle the dynamic nature of modern markets.
Genet (2025, pp. 1–5, 8–10) proposed a framework that uses a learnable base volume curve
as a foundation for real-time adjustments based on evolving market conditions.


### Page 38

2.4.1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Temporal Dependence
RNNs, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are used to capture the
temporal patterns and long-term dependencies inherent in sequential market data. This is
critical because volume forecasting relies heavily on persistence and historical context.
While not purely a forecasting model, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
architectures incorporate volume forecasting (often using RNNs) as their Macro-level
component to determine the initial allocation schedule.
Emphasizing on HRL for VWAP strategy optimization, Li et al. (2022, pp. 1–3, 8, 10)
propose a Macro-Meta-Micro Trader (M3T) framework where the Macro Trader is
dedicated to volume profile estimation. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks, this layer estimates future volume profiles to allocate parent orders into tranches
that match market liquidity. Their analysis confirms that accurately estimating volume
profiles effectively reduces transaction costs and slippage.

2.4.2. Transformer Architectures for Global/Long-Range Dependencies
Transformer models, leveraging their self-attention mechanism, are effective at modeling the
characteristic U-shaped intraday volume pattern and handling large sequences of historical
data by capturing long-term dependencies across the entire trading horizon.
The U-shape Transformer proposed by Kim et al. (2023, pp. 2, 6, 17–18, 25–26)
specifically focuses on handling day-to-day variations and oscillations in the volume
distribution by processing historical volume ratios through a specialized encoder-decoder
structure and is based on a dual-level decomposition strategy for order distribution. The
first level utilizes a Transformer model to capture the global distribution of daily volumes
(the U-shape), while the second level uses an LSTM model to handle the local distribution of
orders within smaller time intervals.

Intuition (TUL Level 1 Allocation):
The TUL approach uses the Transformer for Level 1 (Global) volume allocation. The loss
function explicitly optimizes the predicted volume ratios (𝑢𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑) to track the true cumulative
VWAP, ensuring the macro allocation aids the micro-level execution.

Another transformer based intra-day volume forecasting scheme by Lee & Park (2023, pp. 1–
2, 4, 13) introduces an Intraday Volume Estimator (IVE), which uses a log-normal
transformation to stabilize volume ratios and provides probabilistic forecasting of means and
standard deviations. This approach allows traders to anticipate significant intraday volume
spikes, which is crucial for navigating market volatility.
How Transformers Improve Probabilistic Volume Forecasting?
Transformers offer several key advantages over traditional volume forecasting methods:
-
Long-Range Dependencies with Attention: Unlike LSTMs that struggle with very
long sequences, Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the
importance of different historical time periods. This is crucial for volume forecasting


### Page 42

42
because market volume patterns can have dependencies spanning multiple days (e.g.,
Monday effects, monthly cycles) and cross-asset correlations can be captured
simultaneously across multiple securities. Additionally, the model can learn which
historical periods are most relevant for current predictions.
-
Probabilistic Output Heads: Modern Transformer architectures like the Intraday
Volume Estimator (IVE) don’t just predict point estimates—they output full
probability distributions (often using Student’s t-distribution). This provides mean
forecasts for expected volume (e.g., standard deviation estimates for uncertainty
quantification, confidence intervals for risk-aware execution).
-
Spike Detection Through Uncertainty: High predicted standard deviation correlates
strongly with actual volume spikes. This allows the VWAP system to anticipate
potential liquidity surges, adjust execution aggressiveness proactively and implement
dynamic risk buffers during high-uncertainty periods.
-
Cross-Sectional Learning: Transformers can process multiple assets simultaneously,
learning commonality patterns across sector movements (tech stocks moving
together), index rebalancing effects and macro-driven liquidity shifts. This borrowing
of information significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to single-asset
models.

volume forecasting into a production VWAP system:

1. Feature Engineering Layer: the feature engineering layer comprises classes of features
e.g., input features (e.g., historical volume ratios, LOB data, time-of-day encoding, sector
activity), temporal features (e.g., rolling statistics, volatility measures, market regime
indicators) and, cross-sectional features (e.g., cluster-based volume correlations, index
flows).
2. Transformer Forecasting Engine: contains an encoder (which processes historical
context (past N intervals across M assets), a decoder (to generate future volume distribution
for remaining trading day), an output (consisting of mean 𝝁𝒕 and standard deviation 𝝈𝒕 for
each time bucket) and specification of an update frequency (e.g., every 5-15 minutes or on
significant market events).
Transformers provide not just better point forecasts, but actionable uncertainty estimates that
enable truly adaptive, risk-aware VWAP execution strategies.
2.4.3. Neural Networks for Volume Forecasting (DeepLOB)
Cucuringu et al. (2025, pp. 1–3, 19–20) utilize a DeepLOB neural network design enriched
with auxiliary high-frequency predictors, such as order flow imbalance, to capture intraday
commonalities across stocks. They find that more accurate forecasting models directly result
in a reduction of VWAP tracking error and an increased fill ratio for passive orders.
A sample scheme of this design is shown here:
Figure 16: DeepLOB Architecture


### Page 45

This system contains:
1. Convolutional Layers: to extract local patterns e.g.,
o Temporal patterns: “Volume tends to spike after large price moves”
o Spatial patterns: “Multiple features move together”
2. Inception Module: to captures multi-scale relationships e.g.,
o Short-term: Last 15 minutes behavior
o Medium-term: Last hour trends
o Long-term: Multi-day patterns
3. LSTM: to remember long-term dependencies e.g.,
o “Mondays typically have higher volume than Fridays”
o “Volume increases before major economic announcements”
Comparison of Volume Forecasting Schemes
Accurate forecasts of 𝑉𝑡 (or relative volume curve 𝑔𝑡= 𝑉𝑡/𝑄𝑇) are central to VWAP
performance. Below is a compact comparison.

In practice a blended design approach can be employed for volume forecasting which

avg i.e.
U‑shape), allowing short‑term adjustment (to fit a lightweight time‑series model e.g. AR or


### Page 46

CMEM) on residuals to capture day‑specific deviations, incorporates cross‑sectional signals
(e.g., market‑wide features - index volume, sector flows). The design comprises a
probabilistic head (to produce mean and std deviation of 𝑉𝑡 in a Transformer or
heteroskedastic model to quantify uncertainty and set risk buffers).
The overall system applies an ensemble approach combining the template, time‑series and
ML via weighted blending; using cross‑validation on historical days. This way the system
instills:
-
probabilistic forecasts (mean 𝜇𝑡, std 𝜎𝑡) in the system design which enables
conservative scheduling by increasing execution in periods with high predicted
volume uncertainty to avoid missing VWAP exposure and,
-
applies dynamic risk limits to adjust aggressiveness by confidence intervals (e.g.,
execute to match 𝜇𝑡+ 𝛼𝜎𝑡 when risk‑averse).
3. VWAP Schedules (Static, Dynamic, Adaptive)
In the context of VWAP execution, a schedule (or trading schedule) refers to a time-
dependent plan that specifies exactly how many units to trade at each moment (or time
interval) over the execution horizon — designed to minimize cost, track VWAP, and manage
risk.
A schedule represents a control signal with inputs (e.g., market conditions, risk parameters,
volume forecasts) and output (𝑣𝑡 - the instantaneous trading rate e.g., 5000 units/minute at
10:15 AM)
A schedule answers the question how much should be traded right now — and how will that
change over time?
Formally, it’s a function:
𝑣𝑡= 𝑓(𝑡; forecasts, risk, inventory)
where:
• 𝒕 in [0, T]: current time within trading window (e.g., 9:30 AM – 4:00 PM)
• 𝒗𝒕: asset unit per unit time to execute at time 𝑡


### Page 47

47
• Depends on: volume forecasts (𝑉𝑡), volatility (𝜎𝑡), risk aversion (𝛾), remaining
inventory (𝑞𝑡), impact costs (𝑘, 𝜂)
VWAP execution schedules can be classified as Static, Dynamic, and Adaptive and they
aren’t redundant — they serve distinct purposes, target different risk profiles, satisfy varying
operational constraints, and map to real-world institutional mandates. They are usually
deployed as complementary tools in a production execution toolkit.
Białkowski et al. (2008, pp. 670–671, 688, 921–922, 939) provide foundational definitions
for the execution schedule types. Static execution involves predicting the volume shape once
at the beginning of the day and never revising the schedule. The authors define Dynamic
execution (or theoretical execution) as being based on one-step ahead predictions of the
specific volume part. Finally, Adaptive execution is characterized by adjusting predictions
as the day progresses and market information increases, incorporating all achieved past
volume into the remaining strategy.
A sophisticated production setup is typically a rhythmic orchestration of these schedules
working in tandem:
• Using Static for low-risk, high-compliance orders.
• Dynamic to price guaranteed contracts and set internal benchmarks.
• Adaptive for discretionary, high-alpha mandates — and measure its performance
against Static/Dynamic baselines.
Figure 17: Runtime Routing Among Static, Dynamic and Adaptive Schedules
Having all of them in effect together provides a form of layered defense like a car:
• Static VWAP = Cruise control (set speed, ignore terrain)


### Page 48

48
• Dynamic VWAP = GPS-guided optimal route (precomputed, assumes no traffic)
• Adaptive VWAP = Self-driving AI (reacts to potholes, traffic, weather in real-time)
The system doesn’t delete cruise control because it has self-driving. It can use each when it’s
appropriate. e.g.,
• Dynamic schedule can revert to Static if vol explodes
• Adaptive schedule can fall back to Static if the model drifts
Mechanics of VWAP Schedules
3.1. Static VWAP Schedule
A static VWAP schedule follows a precomputed trading curve proportional to expected
relative volume:
𝑣𝑡
static = 𝑞0 ⋅𝔼[𝑉𝑡]
𝔼[𝑄𝑇]
This formula defines a static VWAP execution schedule—a simple, widely used strategy for
executing a large order in proportion to expected market activity throughout the day.
here,
• 𝒗𝒕
static: The planned trading rate (asset units per unit time) at time 𝑡.
• 𝒒𝟎: Total number of asset units the trader needs to execute (“parent order”).
• 𝔼[𝑽𝒕]: Expected market volume at time 𝑡 (e.g., average volume during 10:00–10:01
AM based on historical data).
• 𝔼[𝑸𝑻]: Expected total market volume over the full trading horizon [0, 𝑇], where 𝑄𝑇=
∫𝑉𝑠
𝑇
0
𝑑𝑠. So 𝔼[𝑄𝑇] = ∫𝔼
𝑇
0
[𝑉𝑠] 𝑑𝑠.
The strategy says:
“At each moment 𝑡, trade a fraction of my total order equal to the fraction of total expected
daily volume that occurs at time 𝑡.”


### Page 49

49
In other words:
• If the trader expects 10% of the day’s volume to happen between 10:00–10:15 AM,
then they should execute 10% of total order in that window.
• This ensures the participation rate matches the market’s natural liquidity rhythm.
This is a form of proportional scheduling or volume participation.
Why Is It Called Static?
Because the entire schedule is computed once at the start of the day using only forecasts
(𝔼[𝑉𝑡]), and never updated—even if actual volume deviates significantly from expectations.
• It is simple, predictable, easy to implement and low latency.
• But can’t adapt to real-time surprises (e.g., a sudden volume spike or drought).
By following this rule, the personal VWAP (i.e. the average execution price) should closely
track the market VWAP, assuming the volume forecast is accurate. This minimizes market
impact and satisfies common institutional mandates that require VWAP-based execution.
→ Precomputed curve based on historical average volume profile (e.g., SPAR).
→ “At 10:00 AM, trade 8% of total order because historically 8% of daily volume occurs
then.”
A Static VWAP schedule:
• allows the execution of large orders invisibly, matching market liquidity rhythm.
• satisfies mandates that require “VWAP benchmark adherence” without active
discretion.
• Regulatory / Client Compliance: Many passive funds, ETFs, index trackers are
contractually obligated to “execute at VWAP” — static VWAP is auditable,
explainable, deterministic.
• Does not need real-time optimization, therefore, its fast, there is no model risk, nor a
feedback loop is required.
• Baseline for TCA: Brokers and clients use static VWAP as the “dumb baseline” to
measure value-add of smarter strategies.


### Page 50

50
e.g., an ETF rebalancing $500M across 500 stocks at month-end → uses static VWAP to
avoid signaling, minimize tracking error, and pass compliance audits.
A Static VWAP schedule is ineffective when volume deviates from the historical average
(earnings day, flash crash, news event).
3.2. Dynamic VWAP Schedule
If future volumes 𝑉𝑡 are known deterministically, the optimal schedule (under quadratic costs
and CARA utility) often matches the relative volume curve when permanent impact is
negligible.
Mitchell et al. (2013, pp. 1547–1548, 1563–1565, 1725–1726, 1741–1743) classify dynamic
algorithms that revise the volume profile based on information available at each period of
time. The authors derive a closed-form dynamic solution that remains optimal as a
benchmark for minimizing the standard deviation between the personal and market VWAPs.
A Dynamic VWAP Schedule:
• generates a mathematically optimal schedule under known forecasts and risk
preferences.
• balances permanent impact, temporary cost, and timing risk analytically.
• It is an essential tool to execute guaranteed VWAP contracts where a broker
assumes risk and must hedge using closed-form solution to price the guarantee.
• It acts as a theoretical benchmark to provide “what optimal schedule looks like”
under idealized assumptions which is further used to calibrate adaptive systems.
• It provides an explainable schedule where every parameter (𝛾, 𝑘, 𝜂, 𝜎) has economic
meaning and is easy to justify to risk/compliance.
Example: A sell-side desk pricing a “Guaranteed VWAP” for a pension fund → uses AC
closed-form to compute hedging cost and optimal execution path.
Dynamic VWAP has a limitation that it assumes perfect knowledge of 𝑉𝑡, 𝜎𝑡 over [0, 𝑇] and
breaks if reality diverges.


### Page 51

51
Dynamic VWAP uses Closed-Form, e.g., Almgren-Chriss and is the risk-controlled optimizer
schedule.
𝑣𝑡
∗= 𝑞0 ⋅𝜅 cosh(𝜅(𝑇−𝑡))
sinh(𝜅𝑇)
,  𝜅= √𝛾𝜎2
2𝜂
→ Curved, often U-shaped — trades faster early and late if risk-averse.
→ Computed once, assumes perfect knowledge of future vol and volume.
In the Almgren–Chriss quadratic case with linear permanent impact 𝑘 and temporary cost
𝜂𝑣2:
• When 𝑘= 0 (no permanent impact): optimal 𝑣𝑡∝𝑉𝑡.
• When 𝑘> 0: optimal schedule front-loads or back-loads depending on sign and risk
aversion; permanent impact penalizes cumulative trading, so the schedule adjusts to
reduce expected slippage variance. In this case the Hamiltonian system yields a
closed‑form solution (hyperbolic functions).
Trader must deviate when 𝑘> 0:
• Front-load if trader is risk-averse and wants to finish early (avoid volatility)
• Back-load if trader wants to minimize permanent cost (but risk adverse price moves)
Closed Form Solutions and Hamiltonian Systems
This is the mathematical foundation for optimal VWAP execution strategies under different
market impact conditions. The fundamental distinction between two optimal Strategies in
VWAP execution based on whether permanent market impact exists:
1. When Permanent Impact = 0 (k=0)
• Optimal Strategy: Trade proportionally to market volume
(𝑣𝑡∝𝑉𝑡)
• Since the trading doesn’t permanently move the market price, we must simply follow
the natural liquidity pattern
• This is the “pure” VWAP strategy that matches the relative volume curve exactly


### Page 52

52
2. When Permanent Impact > 0 (k>0)
• Optimal Strategy: Deviate from pure proportional scheduling through ‘front-loading’
or ‘backloading’ because permanent impact means the trades permanently shift the
market price against the trader, so the algorithm must balance between:
o Trading too aggressively (high permanent impact cost)
o Trading too slowly (high timing risk from price volatility)
This is grounded in the Almgren-Chriss framework, which models trading costs as having
two components:
• Permanent impact (coefficient k): Linear cost that permanently moves the price
• Temporary impact (coefficient η): Quadratic cost from crossing the spread and eating
into order book depth
When both impacts exist, the optimal solution involves hyperbolic functions that represent a
sophisticated trade-off between these competing costs.
Implications
• For agency VWAP (client bears risk): Stick closer to proportional volume matching
since we’re not responsible for permanent impact costs.
• For guaranteed VWAP (broker bears risk): The broker has incentive to frontload
trading to manipulate the VWAP benchmark downward, especially when permanent
impact is significant.


### Page 53

53
This theoretical foundation explains why real-world VWAP algorithms are more
sophisticated than simple volume-proportional execution—they must account for how their
own trading activity affects market prices.
Significance of Closed Form Solutions and Hamiltonian Systems
The mention of ‘Closed-form solutions’ and ‘Hamiltonian systems’ in the VWAP context
is deeply rooted in the mathematical framework used to solve optimal control problems in
trading.
When we say there is a “Closed-form Solution” in existence, that means we can write down
the exact optimal trading strategy as an explicit mathematical formula, rather than needing
numerical methods or simulations.
e.g.,
• when k=0 (no permanent impact): The closed-form solution is simply 𝑣𝑡∝𝑉𝑡 (trade
proportionally to volume)
• when k>0 (with permanent impact): The solution involves hyperbolic functions that
represent the optimal trade-off between impact costs and timing risk
The mention of hyperbolic functions specifically refers to solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-
Bellman (HJB) equation, which is the partial differential equation that characterizes optimal
control problems. When we solve the HJB equation for the Almgren-Chriss model with both
permanent and temporary impact, we get solutions involving hyperbolic sine and cosine
functions.
Hamiltonian Systems in VWAP’s Context
The VWAP execution problem is fundamentally a continuous-time optimal control
problem. We’re trying to find the optimal trading trajectory 𝑣𝑡 (our execution speed over
time) that minimizes a cost function subject to constraints. In optimal control theory, the
Hamiltonian is the central mathematical object that combines:
• the objective function (what we want to minimize/maximize)
• the system dynamics (how our state evolves)
• the constraints
For VWAP execution, the Hamiltonian would typically look like:


### Page 54

54
𝐻= 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚+ 𝜆. 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝐷𝑦𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑠
where:
• 𝑪𝒐𝒔𝒕𝑻𝒆𝒓𝒎 includes market impact costs and risk penalties
• 𝝀 is the “co-state” variable (like a Lagrange multiplier for dynamic constraints)
• 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆𝑫𝒚𝒏𝒂𝒎𝒊𝒄𝒔 describes how the remaining inventory evolves:𝑑𝑞𝑡/𝑑𝑡= −𝑣𝑡
Having closed-form solutions is crucial because the system can calculate the optimal strategy
instantly without running complex numerical optimizations during live trading
(computational efficiency), can understand exactly how parameters affect behavior (i.e.
achieve analytical insights e.g., “as risk aversion γ increases, we front-load more”), can
implement these formulas directly rather than relying on iterative algorithms
(implementation simplicity) and the numerical implementations can be tested against known
analytical solutions (verifiability).
3.3. Adaptive/Stochastic VWAP Schedule
When future volume 𝑉𝑡 is stochastic, adaptive strategies that update 𝑣𝑡 using realized volume
and forecasts outperform static schedules. The optimal adaptive control can be derived via
dynamic programming (DP) (Mitchell et al.; Kato) or approximated using second‑order
expansions (Kato).
Adaptive VWAP strategy is expressed as a state-feedback law by Cheng et al. (2017, pp. 1–
3, 9) which adjusts the trading rate in real time based on the investor's current position to
ensure the target volume is tracked despite order fill uncertainty. This adaptive approach
recovers the classical VWAP strategy when final block trades are strictly prohibited.
It can be visualized as below — the schedule is continuously optimizing the execution path
using real-time market data and probabilistic forecasts. It is more complex but is vastly
superior in the volatile or unpredictable markets.


### Page 55

55
Figure 18: A Typical Adaptive VWAP Workflow
• Reacts to volume surprises, volatility spikes, spread blowouts.
• Aims to maximize P&L in volatile markets e.g., when SPAR fails, this schedule uses
LSTM/ML to front-load if volume dries up, backs off if spread explodes.
• It handles uncertainty using CARA utility and stochastic control and doesn’t just
minimize cost, minimizes the risk-adjusted cost.
• This schedule attempts to exploit microstructure knowledge using
DeepLOB/Transformer models to detect hidden liquidity and adjust child order
size/type in real-time.
Example: Hedge fund executing $100M Apple block during Fed announcement → adaptive
algo slows down when order book thins, accelerates when volume floods in.
A tradeoff of Adaptive schedule is that it incurs higher latency, model drift risk, and is harder
to audit and thus is not suitable for regulated/passive mandates. Practically, such algorithms
recompute schedule at regular intervals using updated forecasts and remaining inventory.

𝟐𝐕𝐚𝐫(cost): The risk penalty. 𝛾 is the CARA (Constant Absolute Risk

2. The Constraint: ∫𝑣𝑡
𝑇
0
𝑑𝑡= 𝑞0 (or 𝑋0 in some notations) ensures the total initial
position is fully liquidated or acquired by the end of the trading horizon 𝑇.
3. The Adaptive Component: The “solve” operation is a dynamic process. Unlike a
static schedule that is fixed at the start of the day, an Adaptive VWAP re-optimizes
the trading rate 𝑣𝑡
∗ at regular intervals (e.g., every 1–5 minutes) using:
o Real-time Volume Forecasts (𝑉𝑡): Updated using models like CMEM, SPAR,
or LSTMs.
o Remaining Inventory (𝑞𝑡): Adjusting for realized fills and market volume
surprises.
Connection to the Closed-Form Solution
When the specific quadratic assumptions of the A-C model hold, the “solution” to this
optimization results in the following closed-form expression:
𝑣𝑡
∗= 𝑞0 ⋅𝜅cosh(𝜅(𝑇−𝑡))
sinh(𝜅𝑇)
where 𝜅= √𝛾𝜎2
2𝜂
This produces the mathematically optimal trading curve that balances market impact
(trading slowly to minimize 𝜂) against timing risk (trading quickly to minimize 𝜎 exposure).
Dynamic Programming (DP) from Adaptive VWAP Perspective
In the stochastic volume case, future market volume 𝑉𝑡 at time 𝑡 is unknown. Only realized
volume can be observed as time progresses. This creates a fundamental uncertainty that
requires sequential decision-making under uncertainty - exactly what DP is designed to solve.


### Page 57

57
Implications of Dynamic Programming (DP) in VWAP Context
DP breaks down the complex multi-period optimization problem into a sequence of simpler
single-period problems. At each time t, it makes the optimal decision given:
• the current state (remaining inventory 𝑋𝑡)
• current information (realized volume so far, current market conditions)
• the optimal value function for future periods
The key insight is defining a value function 𝑉(𝑡, 𝑋𝑡, 𝑉𝑡) that represents the minimum
expected cost-to-go from time 𝑡 onward, given the current state.
For the stochastic volume case, this becomes:
𝑉(𝑡, 𝑋𝑡, 𝑉𝑡) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑡𝐸[𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+ 𝑉(𝑡+ 𝑑𝑡, 𝑋𝑡+𝑑𝑡, 𝑉𝑡+𝑑𝑡)]
where:
• Immediate Cost includes temporary market impact: 𝜂∗(𝑣𝑡²/𝑉𝑡)
• Future Cost is captured by the value function 𝑉(𝑡+ 𝑑𝑡, . . . )
• Expectation accounts for uncertainty in future volume 𝑉𝑡+𝑑𝑡
Instead of pre-committing to a static schedule, DP gives an adaptive policy:
𝑣𝑡∗= 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑡[𝜂∗(𝑣𝑡²/𝑉𝑡) + 𝐸[𝑉(𝑡+ 𝑑𝑡, 𝑋𝑡−𝑣𝑡∗𝑑𝑡, 𝑉𝑡+𝑑𝑡)]]
This means the optimal trading rate at time 𝑡 depends on:
• Current liquidity 𝑉𝑡 (trade more when volume is high)
• Remaining inventory 𝑋𝑡
• Time remaining (𝑇−𝑡)
• Expected future volume dynamics
4. Handling Volume Uncertainty
DP naturally incorporates the volume forecasting model. If the forecast shows high
uncertainty (large variance), the DP solution will be more conservative. If the forecast is
confident about high future volume, the algorithm can afford to trade less aggressively.


### Page 58

58
The following diagram shows how DP transforms VWAP execution from static to adaptive:
Figure 19: Comparing Adaptive versus Static VWAP Schedules
here,
1. Static VWAP: Shows rigid, pre-determined schedule that cannot adapt to market
conditions
2. Adaptive VWAP: Demonstrates the feedback loop where each decision point
observes current market conditions and adjusts accordingly
3. Value Function: Represents the mathematical engine that computes optimal
decisions by balancing immediate costs against expected future costs
4. Decision Diamonds: Show real-time market observation points where the system
decides how aggressively to trade based on current liquidity
5. Arrows to Value Function: Illustrate how every decision uses the DP value function
to make optimal choices
This diagram shows how DP creates an intelligent control system that continuously optimizes
trading decisions based on real-time market information, rather than blindly following a pre-
computed schedule.
Real-time Adaptation Referring back to Figure 2, the closed-loop system continuously:
1. Observes realized volume 𝑉𝑡
2. Updates volume forecasts for remaining periods


### Page 59

59
3. Recomputes the optimal policy using DP principles
4. Adjusts execution accordingly
Risk Management Integration DP naturally handles the risk-return tradeoff. The value
function can include terms for:
• Timing risk (variance of tracking error)
• Market impact costs
• Opportunity costs of incomplete execution
Computational Tractability While the full continuous-time DP leads to PDEs (like the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation mentioned earlier), in practice we can:
• Discretize time into intervals (e.g., 5-minute buckets)
• Use numerical methods to solve the Bellman equation backward in time
• Pre-compute policy functions for common scenarios
• Update policies in real-time as new information arrives
On the other hand, a static VWAP strategy assumes the volume forecast is perfect and never
updates. But in reality:
• Volume forecasts are imperfect - DP accounts for forecast uncertainty
• Markets are dynamic - DP adapts to realized volume deviations
• Risk preferences matter - DP incorporates our specific risk tolerance
• Cost structures are complex - DP optimally balances multiple cost components
The result is significantly better performance: as noted in the research, dynamic strategies can
reduce VWAP tracking error by 37.9% compared to static approaches, precisely because
they use DP principles to adapt optimally to stochastic volume realizations.
DP transforms VWAP execution from a rigid, forecast-dependent schedule into an intelligent,
adaptive control system that makes optimal decisions at every moment based on all available
information.
Sophisticated systems blend or cascade these VWAP execution schedules forming together a
complete, production-grade execution stack., e.g.,

Business Mandate 1 - start with safe, compliant Static baseline, overlay with Dynamic for
risk-controlled deviation (e.g., “if vol > 2σ, slow down by 30%”) and, trigger Adaptive only
when confidence in ML forecast > threshold.
Business Mandate 2 - use Static VWAP unless predicted volume error > 15%, then switch
to Adaptive. If client is Guaranteed VWAP, compute hedge cost via Dynamic first.
The rationale for such blending is due to the following observations:

4. Orchestrating Volume Forecasting and Execution
Scheduling for Optimal VWAP Performance
Effective VWAP execution hinges on the tight integration of volume forecasting (predicting
when liquidity will appear) and execution scheduling (deciding how fast to trade). Rather
than treating them as isolated modules, pragmatic systems orchestrate them in a closed-loop
(forecasts inform optimal child order allocation via risk-aware optimizers - like CARA
utility or Almgren-Chriss framework), while real-time fills and market feedback continuously
retrain and recalibrate forecasts. Strategy selection (Static/Hybrid/Adaptive) is dynamically
governed by market regime detection with hysteresis buffers to avoid flip-flopping —
ensuring robust, low-slippage execution that adapts to volatility, liquidity, and model
confidence without human intervention.


### Page 62

62
The regime detection and subsequent switching is rooted in various studies emphasizing the
dynamic selection of execution schedules based on changing market conditions. Białkowski
et al. (2008, pp. 9, 20, 25) define SETAR (Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive) models
which explicitly allow for regime changes in volume dynamics by applying different
parameters when volume exceeds a specific threshold. The authors highlight that the SETAR
model’s ability to discriminate between turbulent and flat periods is a primary advantage in
reducing execution risk.
A dual-level system design explored by Kim et al. (2023, pp. 3, 6, 11) blends a global
distribution layer (Transformer) with a local distribution layer (LSTM). The model allows
for a choice between a statistical U-shape method (based on historical averages) and a U-
shape Transformer method to capture day-to-day variations that static rules miss. The
system is designed to adapt to changing market conditions by incorporating micro-level
information (Limit Order Book) to influence macro-level order allocation.
The Macro-Meta-Micro Trader (M3T) scheme introduced by Li etc al. (2022, pp. 1, 6, 11).
incorporates a hierarchical architecture designed to capture market patterns at different
temporal scales. The Meta Trader acts as a bridge, selecting short-term subgoals that are
appropriate to the instant liquidity of a specific interval, effectively adjusting the execution
speed to match short-term regime fluctuations.
Emphasizing the execution schedule optimizer loop in Figure 3:
The loop serves as the strategic control hub - determining not only whether to deploy a static,
dynamic, or adaptive schedule, but also when to trigger re-optimization, initiate fallback protocols, or
refresh (retrain) model parameters.
Figure 20: VWAP Schedule Optimization Loop (from Figure 3) Revisited


### Page 63

63
The following examples illustrate how this orchestration can be achieved in practice.
4.1. Example: Generic Blending
A realistic setup tying volume forecasting schemes (CMEM, SPAR, ML e.g. XGBoost, and
Deep Learning e.g. LSTM/Transformer) with execution schedules (Static, Dynamic, and
Adaptive) might look like the following:
Figure 21: Nexus of VWAP Volume Forecasting and Scheduling Schemes
This system allows deployment of all three strategies in parallel — static for compliance and
baseline, dynamic for pricing, hedging, and theoretical anchoring, adaptive for alpha,
resilience, and real-world chaos — all fed by the right forecast method, all closing the loop
with TCA-driven re-training.
Some observations can be drawn here:
1. SPAR → Static VWAP
• SPAR provides deterministic 𝔼[𝑉𝑡] curve.
• Scheduler computes 𝑣𝑡
static = 𝑞0 ⋅
𝔼[𝑉𝑡]
𝔼[𝑄𝑇] once at open.
• No feedback loop — fire and forget.
2. CMEM + Machine Learning (ML) → Dynamic VWAP (Closed-Form)


### Page 64

64
• CMEM forecasts volatility regimes (𝜎𝑡).
• ML (XGBoost) forecasts volume profile (𝑉𝑡).
• Both assumed deterministic and known over [0, T].
• Almgren-Chriss solver generates closed-form hyperbolic schedule.
3. Machine Learning (ML) + Deep Learning (DL) → Adaptive VWAP
• XGBoost: Fast, interpretable volume + spread forecast → updates every 5–15 min.
• LSTM/Transformer: High-frequency microprice or liquidity forecast → adjusts 𝑣𝑡
near toxic events.
• CARA optimizer balances expected cost + risk using real-time forecasts.
• Re-solves optimal 𝑣𝑡
∗ via quadratic program or simplified DP.
4. Feedback Loop: TCA (Transaction Cost Analysis) → Retrain Models
• Slippage attribution (P) identifies:
o Forecast error (predicted 𝑉𝑡 vs. actual)
o Execution error (impact model mismatch)
• Triggers retraining of:
o XGBoost volume model (if MAE > threshold)
o Lasso impact coefficients (if residuals non-stationary)
o LSTM only on end-of-day (too heavy for intraday retrain)
Deployment And Tuning Considerations
• Latency Budget:
o Static: < 1 ms
o Dynamic: ~10 ms (precomputed)
o Adaptive: 50–200 ms (depends on model size)
• Model Refresh:
o SPAR: Daily (exchange update)
o XGBoost: Hourly or after large slippage
o LSTM: End-of-day (unless distilled to lightweight proxy)
• Fallbacks:
o If ML/DL fails → fall back to SPAR + static VWAP


### Page 65

65
o If volatility spikes → switch from XGBoost to CMEM for 𝜎𝑡
Setups like this mirror trading systems — where forecast quality directly shapes execution
aggression, and post-trade analytics close the loop for continuous improvement.
e.g., the following diagram illustrates a use-case-specific setup:
Figure 22: Applying VWAP Schedules and Volume Forecasting to Business Use cases
4.2. Example: Blending Based on Market Regime
Mixing Static and Adaptive strategies (or switching between them based on market regime)
is a typical production-grade VWAP execution setup. The below diagram shows that:

### Page 66

Market Regime Detection
Before choosing or blending strategies, classifying the current environment using real-time
signals:
• Volatility percentile (e.g., >90th %ile → “High Vol”)
• Volume surprise (forecast error > 2σ)
• Order book fragility (spread widening, depth collapse)
• ML model confidence score (low → trigger fallback)
e.g., if volatility spikes + volume forecast error exceeds threshold then activate Hybrid mode.
Blending Static and Adaptive (Hybrid Strategy)
In high Volatility regimes, instead of going full-static (too rigid) or full-adaptive (too risky),
blending can happen:
Example Allocation Logic
if regime == "HighVolatility":
static_weight = 0.7
adaptive_weight = 0.3
schedule = static_weight * static_vwap_curve + adaptive_weight * ml_advisor_signal
Blended profile’s static component ensures compliance and avoids wild swings, provides
audit trail while the adaptive component captures microstructure opportunities (e.g., sudden
liquidity pockets). Blending allows a risk-controlled exposure to ML without full dependency.
Fallback to static if regime worsens (“Extreme Stress”) or ML model confidence drops
below safety threshold:
• Immediately switch to Static VWAP (or even simpler: SPAR or Rolling Mean
baseline).
• Disable all adaptive logic until regime normalizes.
• Log event for post-trade TCA and model retraining.
Feedback Loop - transition back to full Adaptive if in hybrid mode:
• volatility has dropped back to normal
• ML model confidence restored


### Page 67

67
• the participation rate has exceeded max allowed
Smooth Transitions with Decay Weighting
Instead of hard-switching weights (0.7 → 1.0), use exponential decay for graceful handoff:
weight_adaptive = min(1.0, weight_adaptive_prev + 0.1 * regime_improvement_signal)
weight_static = 1.0 - weight_adaptive
This avoids order schedule discontinuities that could trigger unnecessary market impact.
The following decision-making illustrates the above logic in practice:
Figure 24: Deciding A VWAP Execution Strategy Based on Market Regime
4.3. Example: Significance of Fallback Thresholds
Setting fallback thresholds for switching between VWAP execution strategies (e.g., from
Adaptive → Hybrid → Static) is critical for risk control, model reliability, and execution
robustness — especially under volatile or stressed market conditions.
Below is a framework to define, monitor, and act on fallback thresholds — including
quantitative triggers, hysteresis logic, and configurable safety layers.

Thresholds can be instrument-specific (e.g., AAPL vs HYG) and time-of-day adjusted (e.g.,
open/close more volatile).
Hysteresis Logic: Avoid “Flip-Flop” Switching
Not switching back immediately when the threshold clears and waiting for confirmed
stabilization prevents rapid toggling during choppy markets — e.g., volatility spiking above the
threshold, then dipping below, then spiking again within seconds.
Li (2013, pp. 2, 8, 17, 27–28) characterizes the optimal solution for VWAP tracking in terms
of a forward boundary and a backward boundary. These boundaries define an execution
interval that restricts the total remaining shares to be executed. This mathematical structure
establishes three distinct trading regions: Ahead (A), Behind (B), and Trade (T). The
Trade (T) region effectively serves as a buffer zone that tightly tracks the ideal VWAP
trajectory; the agent places limit orders while within this zone and only executes market
orders when the position hits the backward boundary to avoid falling too far "behind" the
schedule.


### Page 70

Figure 25: Applying Hysteresis Buffer Zones to Switch Among VWAP Execution Strategies
A similar idea defining optimal execution boundaries for the "stationary limit" of VWAP
tracking is explored by Cheng et al. (2017, p. 9). They use limit-order and market-order
boundaries using the Lambert W function, which creates an operational range where the
trader adjusts execution speed based on the current distance from the target trajectory. This
state-feedback expression functions as a buffer to ensure the target volume is tracked
despite the uncertainty of order fills.
Having hysteresis buffer zones (intentional delays) prevents chaotic back-and-forth
switching by adding “inertia” so the system doesn’t overreact to noise or temporary blips.
Configurable Safety Layers (Runtime Overridable)
Dynamically adjustable configuration turns static fallback logic into an adaptive, data-driven
control layer that reduces false triggers, improves alpha capture, and enhances risk
management across diverse instruments and sessions.

Regime classification models like GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model), HMM (Hidden Markov
Model), or simple Volatility Clustering automatically detect whether the market is in a
“Calm,” “Elevated,” or “Crisis” state by analyzing real-time signals (volatility, spread,
volume) — enabling the VWAP execution system to dynamically auto-calibrate strategy
thresholds tailored to each asset and time-of-day, rather than relying on brittle, one-size-fits-
all rules.
The regime switching can be included in TCA (Transaction Cost Analysis) reports: “Order
XYZ switched to Static at 10:14:22 due to volatility spike (σ=4.2, threshold=3.0) + ML
confidence drop (0.32). Slippage saved: -82 bps vs projected -140 bps under Adaptive.”

A Dynamic Strategy Router in Execution Pipeline
The following is an example of a self-aware risk-adaptive strategy router for VWAP
execution systems that can dynamically route orders to Static, Hybrid, or Adaptive
strategies based on real-time market regime signals.
Figure 26: Example Dynamic Strategy Router
This router sits between order ingestion and schedule generation. It consumes real-time
metrics and selects the safest and the most effective strategy.
State Machine: Graceful Transitions with Hysteresis Buffer Zones
The router enforces smooth degradation and recovery — avoids chaotic toggling.
Threshold Configuration (Dynamically Loaded):
volatility_95th: 0.025    # 2.5% daily vol
volatility_99th: 0.05     # 5.0%
max_volume_error_sigma: 2.0
min_ml_confidence: 0.6
max_slippage_bps: -50.0
stabilization_minutes: 5
per_instrument_overrides:
HYG:
volatility_95th: 0.04   # More volatile asset → looser trigger
TSLA:
min_ml_confidence: 0.7  # Higher bar for meme stocks


### Page 73

73
This router design is a template that can turn the execution system into a self-aware, risk-
adaptive engine.
Optimal VWAP execution isn’t about picking the “best” forecast or optimizer — it’s about
dynamically coupling them, with guardrails, so the system self-adapts to liquidity, volatility,
and uncertainty — maximizing execution quality while minimizing catastrophic failure.
Conclusion
This paper has presented a cohesive framework for designing high-performance VWAP
execution systems, grounded in the principle that optimal execution emerges not from
isolated components, but from the closed-loop orchestration of three core pillars: predictive
volume forecasting, risk-aware stochastic scheduling, and adaptive strategy routing.
At its foundation, VWAP execution seeks to minimize market impact by aligning order flow
with forecasted intraday volume. The accuracy of these forecasts whether derived from
classical decomposition (CMEM, SPAR), statistical time-series models (ARMA, Rolling
Mean), or modern machine learning techniques (Lasso, Transformers) is critical to
reducing tracking error and slippage. Yet forecasting alone is insufficient; execution must be
dynamically guided by stochastic control frameworks such as Almgren–Chriss, enhanced
with CARA utility to balance transaction costs, risk, and uncertainty. This transforms
probabilistic forecasts into adaptive, risk-calibrated trading schedules.
In practice, however, real-world markets are non-stationary. A static, one-size-fits-all
execution approach quickly deteriorates under volatility spikes, liquidity shocks, or model
drift. Therefore, the paper advocates for an intelligent strategy router that continuously
classifies market regimes—Calm, Elevated, Crisis—using clustering, HMM, or GMM
methods, and dynamically selects or blends execution modes (Static, Hybrid, Adaptive). This
router employs hysteresis buffers to avoid excessive switching and falls back to robust
baseline models (e.g., SPAR) when machine learning forecasts degrade, ensuring graceful
system resilience.


### Page 74

By marrying forecasting precision, stochastic optimization, and regime-aware adaptation with
practical system design, we advance toward a more adaptive, transparent, and robust
paradigm for optimal VWAP execution where algorithms do not merely follow the market,
but intelligently adapt to the evolving narrative.
