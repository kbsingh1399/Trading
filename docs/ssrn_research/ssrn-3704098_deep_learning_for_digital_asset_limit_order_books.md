Abstract
This paper shows that temporal CNNs accurately predict bitcoin spot price movements from
limit order book data. On a 2 second prediction time horizon we achieve 71% walk-forward
accuracy on the popular cryptocurrency exchange coinbase. Our model can be trained in less
than a day on commodity GPUs which could be installed into colocation centers allowing for
model sync with existing faster orderbook prediction models. We provide source code and
data at https://github.com/Globe-Research/deep-orderbook.

Introduction
Digital assets (cryptocurrencies) have a more relaxed regulatory regime than most traditional
ﬁnancial instruments. Due to the nasent technologies typically used, cryptocurrency exchanges
also operate at much higher latencies than traditional assets, tail exchange response time la-
tencies often spanning into several seconds, rather than microseconds. As a consequence, their
orderbooks are likely to contain complex phenomena that are less common in traditional mar-
kets. Due to the longer latencies and richer orderbook phenomena, deep learning becomes a
much more viable tool in predicting cryptocurrency limit order book (LOB) dynamics [1].
Prior work using machine learning techniques in equities and futures markets, suggests that
they are likely to be eﬀective predicting cryptocurrency price movements. Indeed, many papers
showed this to be true by using Bayesian neural networks [2], gradient boosting decision trees [3],
long short-term memory neural networks [4], and many other algorithms. Aside from improved
predictive performance, machine learning techniques also allow a probabilistic interpretation
which classical time series forecasting methods such as ARIMA models lack. With the high
volatility of cryptocurrencies, risk management is even more important. As with many ﬁelds
now, deep learning techniques are increasingly yielding state of the art performance.
Many studies using LOB extract relevant features from the LOB as it is otherwise too high-
dimensional for a ’regular’ implementation of a neural net as they do not scale well to high-
dimensional inputs. The most common solution to this problem, ﬁrst developed for analysing
visual imagery and inspired by our visual cortex, is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Prior work comparing a CNN approach with a traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
traditional stocks showed it led to better results for many prediction horizons [5] (see also [1]
and [6]).
Sirignano[7] introduced spatial neural networks as a low-dimensional means of predicting
the limit order book at a future time conditional on the current state of the limit order book,
incorporating market information deep in the book in a computationally feasible manner (50
GPU clusters at the time).

This paper illustrates the viability of CNN-like architectures on the kind of commodity hard-
ware that a high frequency trader could install into colocation, to show that cryptocurrencies
could beneﬁt from such an approach.

Methodology
2.1
Orderbook and midprice data
We use a high frequency limit order book (see, e.g. [8]) data at 100ms precision, due to the
exchange latency.
Limit order book data is from the cryptocurrency exchange coinbase, an
established spot trading platform for bitcoin to dollar exchange rates. The data spans 9 days
with 50 levels of non-zero best bid and best ask. The minimum price increment on coinbase is
much smaller than traditional futures and equities exchanges, resulting in diﬀerent dynamics,
fewer market participants typically oﬀering quotes on a given price level, and most price levels
have zero depth away from market midprice.
The data contains snapshots every 100ms up to a depth of 50 for 9 consecutive days, from the
12th to the 20th of June 2019. Each order is described by its price and volume. A depth of 50 for
both bid and ask thus means each timestep contains 200 features. The data is near continuous
and not discretized ticks. Figure 1 shows the midprice evolution during the time period.

resolution
The range of the price and volume is wildly diﬀerent and not of a suitable magnitude for our
neural network so we ﬁrst normalise the data. We standardize the data by using the mean and
standard deviation of the previous day’s prices and volumes i.e. xnorm = x−¯x
σx . This is because
the distributions of both price and volume can shift signiﬁcantly in a few days time.
While Sirignano [7] found phenomena deep in the orderbook for equities (around 25 levels)
and others have found phenomena around 10 levels deep for futures [5], we found the majority
of value within the top 10 bid and ask price levels as the very minor performance improvement
was not worth the increased computational cost, see ﬁgure 3 (a).
Existing literature has often taken 40 features and 100 timesteps e.g. in [5] and [9]. In ﬁgure
1, we see solid green lines at top of the prices as buying is usually set higher and for asks we see
the opposites as selling is cheaper. Such instances are fed into the model to predict mid price
changes. The colour bar shows negative values as that was used to distinguish between buy and
sell and the data is not normalised while creating this heat map.
We look to predict movement in the midprice of the bitcoin to dollar exchange rate, deﬁned as
usual as pt = (pa(t) + pb(t))/2 where pa(t) is the price of the best ask at time t and similarly pb(t)
is the price of the best bid at t. Deﬁning the k-averaged midprices m−/+ before and including
time t (−) and immediately after time t (+) as

We took α = 0.002 after an exhaustive search, consistent with similar studies e.g. [9]. Since
midprices rarely change every 100ms, the resulting lt were highly class imbalanced as shown in
Figure 1. To resolve this we randomly downsampled to remove excessive price-constant (Stable)
events i.e. l0 from the data. The total samples decreased from 4, 219, 932 before balancing to
1, 681, 407 after downsampling.
2.2
Model Architecture
We use a Temporal Convolution Neural Networks [10] for time series prediction. TCNs have
been designed from two basic principles, which are very crucial to the time series predictions:
• The padding for convolutions are causal. This prevents any information leakage from future
to past.
• The architecture can take a sequence of any length and map it to an output sequence of
the same length just as with an RNN.
We chose TCN over their counterparts like GRU and LSTM for reasons such as low memory
requirement, parallelism, ﬂexibility to play around with receptive ﬁelds gave us a huge reduction
in training time, considering the dataset size at 100ms resolution.
We used a kernel size of 2 and calculated a dilation number of 6 from the relation
timesteps = 1 + 2(kernel_size −1)(2dilation_number −1)
2.3
Evaluation
2.3.1
Training
The parameters of the model are learnt by minimising the categorical cross entropy loss. ADAM
is used as an optimizer with setting the learning rate as 0.01 and ϵ as 10e-7. The early stopping
callback is used to stop training when the validation loss doesn’t improve after 4 epochs. We also
use ReduceLROnPlateau[12], which reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if the validation
loss doesn’t improve for 2 epochs. We train with a batch size of 128.
2.3.2
Validation
The model is of an appropriate size as demonstrated by ﬁgure 6. Any over- or under-ﬁtting
would show up on the loss curves and would indicate a potential need of a strategy to prevent
overﬁtting such as regularization or dropout. After training for 57 epochs using the method
described in section 2.3.1, we present our results as a confusion matrix of the recall on the test
dataset, as can be seen in ﬁgure 5.

Results
We use a walkforward approach as depicted in ﬁgure 2, testing out training periods of length 1
day to 7 days, but keeping the test period as 1 day and walking forwards through the dataset.
3.1
Strong predictive accuracy
Unsurprisingly, it was far easier to predict price stability - even in a downsampled dataset with
class balance - but with suﬃcient predictive accuracy to aid a market making algorithm, yielding
around 61% accuracy on downward movements on a 2 second horizon, 66% for upward price
movements using a 7 day training, 1 day testing (after training period) split. Overall performance
of the temporal CNNs in cryptocurrencies here is comparable to the results of Siginano [7] in
equities.
Whilst our dataset is limited, we ﬁnd in general that models do not "wear oﬀ" noticeably
in accuracy over the course of a day, suggesting much slower market response to existing pre-
dictability (Figure 2 (b)). This points to far less regular model reﬁtting being required, alongside
the improved model performance seen with longer training windows (Figure 3

Market and model mechanics
We explore how varying the predictive time horizon, depth of book and training time period,
using the model as a lens on the mechanics of the market in Figure 3. Notably:
1. Orderbook phenomena on coinbase appear quite shallow in the book, without any perfor-
mance gains past 10 levels, and an overall decline due to what should best be interpreted
as "noise features" from the model’s perspective.
2. In contrast to classic logistic regression models of price movements based on orderbook
data for futures and equities on e.g. the CME or NASDAQ, model performance improves
signiﬁcantly with a long training period, compared to the intraday retraining often used
for other asset classes.
3. Predictability of midprice movement remains for quite a while, often for up to a minute on
coinbase.

Overall, we ﬁnd rather diﬀerent behaviour in cryptocurrency orderbooks compared to tra-
ditional assets. Given the architecture of the model, it is likely capturing the persistence and
relative strength of orderbook imbalance for the 5 or so best bids and asks, likely oﬀering bet-
ter performance than the appropriate logistic regression model equivalent, although also likely
requiring a longer training period (still increasing at the limit of the length of our dataset).

Conclusion
Deep learning techniques have a long history in quantitative trading in traditional ﬁnance, but
their real world applications to high frequency trading are relatively new. In the spirit of Tin-
bergen, we present a short list of stylized facts about their application:
1. Deep learning models provide higher latency predictions than traditional machine learning
techniques in predicting price movements from historic data.
2. Whilst we don’t explicitly validate that this is the case for cryptocurrency orderbooks, it
is well established for traditional assets that deep learning models provide more accurate
forecasts of price action from historic orderbook movements.
3. Deep learning models are, as of 2020, viable for use in colocation centers - trainable within
a suﬃciently short time horizon on aﬀordable commodity GPUs to catch the rapid market
regime evolution typical of ﬁnancial instruments (hours to days).
4. Market regime durations for cryptocurrency orderbook phenomena are hours to days.
5. Cryptocurrency orderbooks have a "memory" of at least the last 10 seconds in existing
spot markets.
The temporal CNNs used in the paper are relatively nascent, and we expect further improve-
ments on their architecture, training etc. in the future which will only further beneﬁt market
participants looking to deploy such technology.
We believe that further extensions of this work are likely to look at
1. The joint distributions between the orderbooks of the emerging derivatives markets for
digital assets and their spot-market equivalent orderbooks.
2. The regime durations of these markets and the likely improvements of move online mod-
elling e.g. via online training downweighting older events in stochastically sampled batches.
3. The orderbook depth at which price-movement predictive phenomena occur for cryptocur-
rency spot markets is about 10 levels, comparable to futures markets, and shallower than
equities markets, although this may change.
