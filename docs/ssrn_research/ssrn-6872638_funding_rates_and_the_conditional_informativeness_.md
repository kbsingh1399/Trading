Abstract
One of the key institutions in a perpetual futures contract is the funding-rate mechanism, yet
its role in information processing remains largely unexplored. This paper examines the
question using the Binance XAUUSDT gold perpetual, a commodity-linked cryptocurrency
perpetual introduced in January 2026, and 203,037 one-minute observations from its early
trading period. In this benchmark-anchored instrument, whose reference value is discovered
off-exchange, the order-flow proxies used in the paper have no unconditional predictive
ability: trade-based order-flow imbalance is insignificant in-sample, produces negative out-
of-sample predictive R-squared, and fails to survive multiple-testing corrections. The active
channel is instead the funding mechanism. The funding rate positively predicts returns at
five-, fifteen-, and thirty-minute horizons (t = 2.22, 2.95, 3.71), while the funding-by-order-
flow interaction is negative and significant at all three horizons (t = -2.64, -2.28, -2.26). The
positive funding coefficient captures the persistence and directional component of leverage-
driven demand, whereas the negative interaction captures the marginal reversal effect of
additional buying pressure when positioning is already crowded. Session-level patterns
around the European window are stable in sign but do not survive multiple-testing correction,
alternative window definitions, alternative normalisations, or non-overlapping sampling
schemes; event-study and placebo evidence do not isolate the London afternoon fix as the
source of the pattern. The effects are small and not profitable once trading costs are
considered. The evidence points to a funding-based positioning-and-reversal channel rather
than a classical informed-trading channel in commodity-linked perpetuals.

1. Introduction


### Page 2

2
The defining feature that separates a perpetual futures contract from every dated future is that
it never expires, and is instead tethered to its reference price by a funding payment exchanged
between longs and shorts. This mechanism has become the central price-anchoring device of
crypto derivatives, but its role in the transmission of information into prices has not been
studied. The question becomes especially sharp in a new instrument: the commodity-linked
perpetual — a stablecoin-settled, continuously traded contract referencing an externally
priced commodity benchmark rather than a crypto-native asset, of which the Binance
XAUUSDT gold perpetual (launched January 2026) is the leading example. In such a
contract the fundamental price is discovered off-exchange, in the deep over-the-counter and
futures markets for gold. We therefore ask not merely whether exchange-level order flow
predicts returns, but which channel carries return-relevant information when fundamental
value is set elsewhere: raw trade flow, as classical microstructure would predict, or the
funding mechanism that prices leveraged positioning.
Three design features make this a question about market architecture rather than a routine
predictability test. First, the contract trades 24 hours a day, but its gold index is live only
during gold-market hours and is held fixed otherwise, with a smoothed off-hours mark price
— so the very availability of fundamental information varies within the trading day. Second,
funding is settled every four hours and summarises the net positioning pressure in the
contract; it is an internal, near-continuous restoring force with no analogue in equities or
dated futures, and it prices the state of leveraged demand directly. Third, the information
events most relevant for gold — the twice-daily London (LBMA) fixes — fall on an external
institutional calendar that maps onto only part of the trading day. Together these imply that,
in a benchmark-anchored perpetual, exchange-level order flow may convey little about gold’s
value, while the funding mechanism may carry the information that flow does not. The
contract’s design, in other words, predicts where information should and should not appear
— a hypothesis we take directly to the data using 203,037 one-minute observations covering
the contract from launch through 21 May 2026.
The evidence supports this architecture in two mutually reinforcing parts. The first is a
disciplined null: raw minute-level trade-based order-flow imbalance has no unconditional
predictive power for short-horizon returns — insignificant in-sample, negative out-of-sample
R-squared, and not surviving a multiple-testing correction across the fifteen session-by-
horizon cells we examine. Rather than a disappointment, this is consistent with what a
benchmark-anchored design would imply: when fundamental value is discovered off-
exchange, on-exchange flow should carry limited standalone information about it. The
second part is the paper’s central result and identifies the active channel. Order-flow
informativeness is conditional on the funding regime: the imbalance-by-funding interaction is
negative and significant at all three horizons (t = -2.64, -2.28, -2.26), and the funding rate is
itself a positive and significant predictor at every horizon (t = 2.22, 2.95, 3.71) and the single
most robust relationship in the study. These two coefficients are not in tension but capture
distinct forces. The positive funding main effect reflects the persistence of the funding state
and the directional component of leveraged demand — a high funding rate tends to
accompany subsequent positive returns. The negative interaction captures a marginal effect of
a different kind: once that state is already crowded (high funding), an additional minute of

buying pressure is more likely to represent crowded, over-extended positioning, and is
therefore followed by a reversal rather than continuation. The resulting mechanism is
positioning-and-reversal — exchange flow conveys information about the state of leveraged
positioning, which funding prices — rather than classical informed trading about gold value.
Consistent with the same architecture, session-level effects around the European window are
directionally stable but fragile (they do not survive multiple-testing correction, alternative
session boundaries, alternative normalisations, or non-overlapping sampling), and an event
study with placebo windows does not isolate the London afternoon fix; we report them as
suggestive only. Every documented effect is small and not exploitable net of trading costs —
we present them as evidence about market structure, not as a tradable strategy.
We make three contributions. First and most substantively, we characterise the information
architecture of a benchmark-anchored perpetual: return-relevant information is transmitted
through the funding mechanism and positioning dynamics rather than through raw order flow,
and order-flow informativeness is conditional on the funding state. Because this links a
contract’s institutional design — its funding cadence, its off-hours index/mark-price
construction, and its leverage — to the way information enters prices, it speaks directly to the
market design of the fast-growing commodity-linked perpetual class. Second, we provide the
first high-frequency microstructure evidence on a gold-linked cryptocurrency perpetual, an
instrument bridging commodity derivatives and digital-asset markets that has not previously
been examined at this level. Third, we establish a robust structured null on unconditional
trade-imbalance predictability — a disciplined contrast with the strong predictability
documented for depth-based order-flow imbalance in equity limit order books, and itself a
prediction of the benchmark-anchored architecture.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting.
Section 3 reviews the related literature. Section 4 details the data and variable construction.
Section 5 sets out the methodology. Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 reports
robustness. Section 8 discusses implications, and Section 9 concludes.
2. Institutional Background
2.1 The Binance XAUUSDT perpetual
The XAUUSDT contract is a USDT-settled perpetual futures contract referencing the price of
one troy ounce of gold, launched by Binance on 5 January 2026 and operated by Nest
Exchange Limited under the regulation of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the
Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Unlike a dated commodity future, it has no expiry;
unlike physical gold, it is cash-settled in a stablecoin; and unlike the underlying spot market,
it trades continuously, 24 hours a day, with leverage. Our sample therefore covers essentially
the entire trading history of the instrument from inception, which we treat as early-market
evidence.
2.2 The funding-rate mechanism
Because the contract never expires, its price is tethered to the gold index through a periodic
funding payment exchanged between long and short holders. When the perpetual trades at a


### Page 4

premium to the index, longs pay shorts, and vice versa, creating a restoring force toward the
benchmark. For XAUUSDT the funding rate is settled every four hours and is capped at plus
or minus two percent per interval. This four-hourly cadence, rather than the eight-hourly
cadence common to major crypto perpetuals, is the relevant frequency for any funding-
conditioned analysis. Economically, the funding rate summarises the net positioning pressure
in the contract: a persistently positive rate reflects crowded long demand, a negative rate
crowded short demand.
2.3 The external benchmark and the index/mark-price construction
The contract’s index price aggregates gold quotations from multiple vendors and updates
every second during gold-market hours; outside those hours the index is held fixed at its last
value, while the mark price that governs liquidations is propagated by an exponentially
weighted moving average to damp off-hours swings, subject to a deviation cap (illustratively
plus or minus three percent for XAUUSDT). This design is central to interpreting intraday
results: during gold off-hours the reference price is mechanically static, so contract-price
movements and order flow in those windows reflect inventory and liquidity dynamics on the
exchange rather than fresh information impounded from a live benchmark. We return to this
point when interpreting the overnight session.
2.4 The LBMA gold fixes and intraday information
The global reference prices for physical gold are the twice-daily LBMA fixes, conducted at
10:30 and 15:00 London time, which concentrate institutional participation and are
documented sources of short-horizon price adjustment in the traditional gold market
(Caminschi and Heaney, 2014). Because the contract’s index is live during London hours, the
European trading window is the period in which externally generated benchmark information
is most likely to enter the perpetual. We note, however, that the London afternoon fix falls at
15:00 UTC under Greenwich Mean Time and 14:00 UTC under British Summer Time; under
a fixed 08:00-14:00 UTC definition of the European session, the afternoon fix lies at or
beyond the session boundary. We use this institutional timing to motivate, rather than to
assert, a benchmark-timing interpretation of the session results, and we test it explicitly in
Section 7.
3. Related Literature
3.1 Order flow and market microstructure
The information content of order flow is a central question in market microstructure. The
sequential-trade and strategic-informed-trader models of Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and
Kyle (1985) predict that net directional order flow conveys information about fundamental
value, as informed agents trade in the direction of their private signals and prices adjust
toward efficient levels; O’Hara (2015) synthesises how these mechanisms operate at high
frequency. Consistent with the theory, signed order flow has measurable price impact and
some short-horizon predictive content: Cont, Kukanov, and Stoikov (2014) show that a
depth-based order-flow imbalance built from revisions in best bid and ask depth predicts
short-horizon equity price changes, and Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2002) find that
aggregate order imbalance forecasts market returns and liquidity. The empirical micro-


### Page 5

foundations rest on trade-direction classification (Lee and Ready, 1991), on liquidity and
price-impact measures (Amihud, 2002), and on order-flow-toxicity diagnostics for high-
frequency markets (Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O’Hara, 2012). Two features of this
evidence matter here. First, it is drawn overwhelmingly from equities, conventional dated
futures, and limit-order-book venues. Second, the canonical imbalance measures are depth-
based, whereas our measure is trade-based — computed from executed buyer- and seller-
initiated volume rather than quote-level depth — so it captures realised directional pressure
rather than book revisions, and we do not treat our coefficients as directly comparable to the
depth-based OFI of Cont, Kukanov, and Stoikov (2014).
3.2 Perpetual futures and the funding-rate mechanism
Perpetual futures differ from dated futures because they have no maturity and therefore no
terminal convergence through contract expiry. Their benchmark linkage is maintained instead
through the funding-rate mechanism: periodic payments between long and short holders that
penalise one-sided deviations from the reference price. Economically, the funding rate
summarises net long-short pressure, basis pressure relative to the benchmark, and the cost of
maintaining leveraged exposure, and it has become the central price-anchoring device in
crypto derivatives. Existing high-frequency studies of perpetual and crypto derivatives focus
primarily on Bitcoin markets: Alexander, Choi, Park, and Sohn (2020) document BitMEX’s
role in bitcoin price discovery, Alexander, Heck, and Kaeck (2022) study Binance’s role in
volatility transmission, and Makarov and Schoar (2020) analyse arbitrage frictions and
persistent cross-platform price differences. This literature is the natural background for our
setting, but it has not examined a commodity-linked perpetual whose reference value is
discovered in traditional gold markets.
3.3 Crypto derivatives, basis, and price discovery
A large literature asks where price discovery occurs in fragmented, continuously trading
crypto markets. Findings on spot-versus-futures leadership are mixed and time-varying: Baur
and Dimpfl (2019) and Entrop, Frijns, and Seruset (2020) document shifting leadership
driven by relative trading costs and volume, Alexander and Heck (2020) find that unregulated
derivatives venues dominate price discovery, and Fassas, Papadamou, and Koulis (2020)
study bitcoin-futures price discovery, with the common toolkit being the cointegration and
information-share framework (Engle and Granger, 1987; Hasbrouck, 1995). Closest to our
microstructural focus, Aleti and Mizrach (2021) examine the spot and futures market
microstructure of bitcoin. Venue thinness and design materially affect these estimates
(Adammer, Bohl, and Gross, 2016), and the integrity of crypto volume and pricing has itself
been scrutinised (Griffin and Shams, 2020; Corbet, Lucey, Urquhart, and Yarovaya, 2019).
This work is almost entirely about native crypto assets; commodity-linked crypto perpetuals
are essentially unstudied.
3.4 Gold market microstructure and price discovery
For gold specifically, price discovery has traditionally been located in established venues: the
OTC London market with its twice-daily LBMA benchmark fixes, and COMEX futures.
Caminschi and Heaney (2014) document short-horizon information leakage around the
London PM fix; Hauptfleisch, Putnins, and Lucey (2016) decompose price discovery

between London and New York; Garbade and Silber (1983) provide the classic futures-
versus-cash price-discovery framework; and O’Connor, Lucey, Batten, and Baur (2015)
survey the financial economics of gold. This matters because a gold-linked perpetual is
anchored to a price that is largely discovered off-exchange. If the external benchmark and the
funding mechanism jointly absorb fundamental information, exchange-level order flow on
the perpetual may be comparatively uninformative about gold value — the opposite of what
order-flow theory predicts for venues where price discovery happens on-book.
3.5 Where this paper fits
These literatures have developed largely in isolation: order flow and market microstructure in
equities and dated futures; funding, basis, and price discovery in native crypto derivatives;
and gold price discovery in traditional London and COMEX venues. This paper connects the
three. To our knowledge, no existing study examines whether minute-level trade-based order-
flow imbalance predicts short-horizon returns in a commodity-linked perpetual whose
reference value is discovered off-exchange. The Binance XAUUSDT contract is a useful
laboratory for this question because it combines continuous, crypto-style trading, leveraged
stablecoin settlement, an external gold benchmark, and a funding mechanism that prices
positioning pressure directly.
4. Data and Variable Construction
4.1 Data source and sample
Our main data are tick-level trades collected from the Binance Futures API. The API query
window begins on 1 January 2026, but the usable sample starts with the launch of the
XAUUSDT contract on 5 January 2026 and ends on 21 May 2026. Each tick record contains
a millisecond-precision timestamp, transaction price, quantity, and a buyer/seller aggressor
indicator. We aggregate the raw ticks into one-minute OHLCV bars and remove bars with
missing or zero-volume observations, yielding a final sample of 203,037 one-minute
observations.
4.2 Variable construction
Trade-based order-flow imbalance (OFI). We construct a trade-based order-flow imbalance
measure, OFI(t) = BuyVolume(t) - SellVolume(t), the difference between buyer- and seller-
initiated executed volume in minute t, with the aggressor side taken directly from the Binance
trade feed (avoiding the Lee-Ready (1991) algorithm). This measure is inspired by, but
distinct from, the depth-based OFI of Cont, Kukanov, and Stoikov (2014), which is
constructed from changes in best bid/ask depth in the limit order book.
Normalised OFI (NOFI). To facilitate comparison across periods of differing depth, we
define NOFI(t) = OFI(t) / (BuyVolume(t) + SellVolume(t)), bounded in [-1, 1], with values
near plus (minus) one indicating minutes in which volume was overwhelmingly buyer-
(seller-) initiated.

Funding rate. The Binance funding rate for XAUUSDT is collected at its native four-hourly
settlement frequency and merged onto the one-minute panel by a backward as-of join, so that
each minute carries the most recently settled rate strictly available at that minute. The funding
effects we report are therefore predictive, using only past-settled information, and are not a
contemporaneous identity.

4.4 Descriptive statistics
Table 2 reports distributional properties of the two order-flow measures. OFI is near-
symmetric and fat-tailed; NOFI is approximately mean-zero and bimodal, reflecting minutes
dominated by one-sided flow. Appendix Figures A1 and A2 plot the full distributions and
normal quantile-quantile diagnostics, confirming the heavy tails of OFI (excess kurtosis 6.4)
and the bimodality of NOFI, whose mass concentrates near plus and minus one in fully one-
sided minutes.

5. Methodology
Our baseline predictive regression for horizon h in {5, 15, 30} minutes is
ret_fwd_h(t) = α + β·NOFI(t) + γ·OFI(t) + δ·Volume(t) + Σ θ(j)·Session(j,t) + φ1·ret_1m(t) +
φ2·ret_5m(t) + ε(t),
estimated by OLS with Newey-West (1987) heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-
consistent standard errors (lags = 5); inference is unchanged under the Andrews (1991)
automatic-bandwidth HAC estimator. Because the 5-, 15-, and 30-minute forward returns
overlap, the regression error is serially correlated by construction (Hansen and Hodrick,
1980), which the HAC correction accommodates and which we further address through non-
overlapping re-estimation in Section 7. To examine the funding channel we add the most
recently settled funding rate and, crucially, its interaction with order flow:
ret_fwd_h(t) = α + β1·NOFI(t) + β2·Funding(t) + β3·[NOFI(t)×Funding(t)] + controls + ε(t).

A non-zero β3 implies that the informativeness of order flow is conditional on the funding
regime. We also re-estimate the baseline within each session, split the sample by the sign and
by quintiles of funding, and assess economic significance by sorting minutes into NOFI
quintiles and comparing forward returns gross and net of realistic trading costs. Section 7
subjects the findings to an extensive robustness battery. All forward returns are expressed in
basis points.
6. Results
6.1 The benchmark-anchored null: order flow is unconditionally uninformative
We begin with the unconditional benchmark, which the architecture of Section 2 predicts
should be uninformative. Table 3 reports the baseline regression. The NOFI coefficient is
economically negligible and statistically insignificant at every horizon (t = 0.42, 0.19, -0.18).
The null is robust rather than fragile: it is unchanged across Newey-West lag lengths of 3, 5,
and 10; the out-of-sample predictive R-squared is negative; rolling-window estimation finds
significance in only about eleven percent of windows; and a leave-one-week-out jackknife
leaves the full-sample coefficient near zero (mean +0.016, same sign in 71 percent of weeks).
The only marginally non-zero baseline term is the contemporaneous OFI coefficient at the 5-
minute horizon (-0.0015, t = -1.80), which points to a very weak and non-robust short-
horizon reversal. Minute-level trade imbalance is not, on its own, a stable predictor of short-
horizon returns in this market (Figure 1). We treat this structured null, rather than any session
anomaly, as the paper’s first result.

6.2 The funding channel: funding rates predict short-horizon returns
When the most recently settled funding rate is added to the baseline, it is positive and
strongly significant at all three horizons (Table 4, row Funding: t = 2.22, 2.95, 3.71), while
the NOFI main effect remains insignificant. The funding rate enters as a small decimal four-
hourly rate (sample mean 0.7 basis points, standard deviation 5.0 basis points, capped at plus
or minus two percent but rarely approaching that bound), so the raw per-unit coefficient is not
directly interpretable. Standardised by the in-sample funding standard deviation, a one-
standard-deviation increase in the funding rate raises the forward return by approximately
0.14, 0.38, and 0.71 basis points at the 5-, 15-, and 30-minute horizons — modest in absolute
terms but estimated with high precision. As Section 7 shows, the funding effect is the single
most robust relationship in the paper: it stays positive and mostly significant across leave-
one-month-out, leave-one-week-out, extreme-event exclusions, and every alternative order-
flow normalisation.

6.3 The conditionality of order flow on the funding regime


### Page 10

10
The same specification reveals the paper’s central mechanism. The interaction between order
flow and funding is negative and significant at every horizon (Table 4, row NOFI x Funding:
-263.2, -410.3, -625.7; t = -2.64, -2.28, -2.26). The informativeness of order flow is thus
conditional on the funding state rather than constant. Before interpreting the interaction, we
stress that it does not contradict the positive funding main effect of Section 6.2: the two
coefficients capture distinct forces. The positive main effect reflects the persistence and
directional component of the funding state itself — a high funding rate tends to accompany
subsequent positive returns. The negative interaction is a marginal effect of a different kind
— it describes how an additional unit of buying pressure is rewarded, conditional on that
state. In standardised terms, a one-standard-deviation rise in funding shifts the NOFI slope by
about -0.13, -0.21, and -0.31 basis points at the three horizons, enough to offset and reverse
the small positive slope that prevails when funding is low. The sign has a direct positioning
interpretation: when funding is positive — longs are crowded and pay shorts — a minute of
strong buying pressure is more likely to represent over-extended positioning and is followed
by lower returns, a reversal; when funding is negative, the same buying pressure is followed
by continuation. Splitting the sample by the sign of funding confirms the pattern: the NOFI
coefficient is negative throughout the positive-funding subsample and positive throughout the
negative-funding subsample (Table 5). Although the subsample coefficients are individually
imprecise, their signs are uniform across horizons and consistent with the interaction estimate,
and a funding-quintile analysis shows the same gradient (positive NOFI slopes in the lowest-
funding bins, turning negative in the highest). Because the funding rate enters as the most
recently settled value (a backward as-of merge), the interaction is predictive rather than
contemporaneous by construction, and lagging funding by one or two further settlement
intervals preserves the negative sign at every horizon (Appendix Table A2). Figure 2
visualises both facets.

6.4 Session patterns: directionally stable but suggestive


### Page 11

Stratifying the baseline by session (Table 6) produces a positive NOFI coefficient in the
European window at 15 minutes (β = 0.290, t = 2.18) and a negative coefficient in the
overnight window at 30 minutes (β = -0.653, t = -1.69). We interpret these as suggestive
rather than established. After correcting for the fifteen session-by-horizon tests, no session
coefficient remains statistically significant: the p-value for the European 15-minute
coefficient rises from 0.029 to 0.435 under the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment, with Holm
and Bonferroni corrections leading to the same conclusion. As Section 7 shows, the European
coefficient weakens under shifted session boundaries, disappears under alternative order-flow
normalisations, and changes sign under non-overlapping sampling; a fix-window placebo
also fails to identify the London fix as the source of the pattern. The overnight coefficient is
directionally stable but does not reach conventional significance and, given the fixed off-
hours index and smoothed mark price documented in Section 2.3, may be partly mechanical.
We therefore report these as directionally stable session-level patterns rather than definitive
anomalies.

6.5 No tradable alpha: the contribution is to market structure
Finally, we assess economic significance by sorting minutes into NOFI quintiles. The spread
between the highest- and lowest-NOFI quintiles is small and, consistent with the reversal
pattern above, negative: -0.198 bps (t = -4.44), -0.137 bps (t = -1.75), and -0.146 bps (t = -
1.29) at 5, 15, and 30 minutes (Table 7). Against a conservative round-trip cost of about 14
bps (a 4.5 bps taker fee, a 1.0 bps half-spread, and 1.5 bps of slippage, applied at entry and
exit), the net spread is roughly -14 bps at every horizon. Combined with the negative out-of-
sample R-squared and the intermittent rolling-window significance documented above, this

establishes that order flow does not provide a directly tradable signal in this contract. We
therefore interpret the paper’s findings as informative about the information structure of the
market rather than about implementable trading alpha.

7. Robustness
Because the sample spans the contract’s first months of trading, we treat it as early-market
evidence and address the concern that the results are sample-period specific with a battery of
checks that hold the data fixed (Appendix Table A1). The extended tests reinforce the
structured-null interpretation. The full-sample NOFI coefficient remains economically small
and statistically insignificant across alternative Newey-West lag lengths, rolling windows,
alternative normalisations, and extreme-event exclusions. Leave-one-month-out and leave-
one-week-out tests show strong sign stability for the key European 15-minute, overnight 30-
minute, and funding-rate coefficients, so the results are not driven by a single calendar month
or isolated week: across the 21 weekly jackknife samples the European and overnight effects
are 100 percent sign-consistent, and the funding effect is positive in every leave-one-out
sample.
The funding-rate mechanism is the most robust relationship. Funding coefficients stay
positive across leave-one-period-out and extreme-event tests and across all alternative order-
flow normalisations, and the NOFI-by-funding interaction is significantly negative at all three
horizons. The session-specific NOFI evidence, by contrast, should be interpreted cautiously.
The European 15-minute coefficient is significant under conventional single-test inference (p
= 0.029) but does not survive a multiple-testing adjustment across the session-by-horizon grid
(Benjamini-Hochberg, Holm, and Bonferroni-adjusted p = 0.435); it weakens under shifted
session boundaries (the t-statistic falling to about 1.1), loses significance under alternative
NOFI normalisations such as a rolling z-score or rolling-volume scaling, and changes sign
under non-overlapping (every-15-minute) return sampling. A randomised-NOFI placebo
places the European 15-minute coefficient at the 7.4 percent tail of its permutation
distribution — suggestive, but not decisive.
We also probe the funding interaction for residual endogeneity. The baseline uses the most
recently settled funding rate (a backward as-of merge), so the interaction is predictive rather
than a same-period identity. Lagging funding by one and two further four-hour settlement
intervals leaves the interaction negative at every horizon — for example -453 (t = -1.63) at 30
minutes under a one-period lag and -294 (t = -1.67) at 15 minutes under a two-period lag —
although its significance attenuates as the funding signal grows staler. This sign stability
under additional lagging argues against a mechanical contemporaneous explanation and is
consistent with the interaction reflecting the current state of leveraged positioning, which is
most informative when funding is measured recently. Under non-overlapping (every-h-


### Page 13

13
minute) sampling the interaction is negative and significant at the 5-minute horizon (-379, t =
-1.96) and negative though insignificant at 30 minutes, indicating that the short-horizon result
is not an artifact of overlapping returns.
The benchmark-timing evidence does not support a fix-specific channel. In the placebo
exercise, randomly allocated pseudo-fix windows reproduce the pre-fix order-flow coefficient
in roughly half of all draws, and the event study around the London fixes does not single out
the afternoon fix as a reliable predictor of returns. The timing also complicates a fix
interpretation: under the fixed 08:00-14:00 UTC European-session definition, British
Summer Time shifts the afternoon fix to the edge of, or outside, the session window. We
therefore interpret the European-session coefficient as a weak institutional-time pattern rather
than as evidence of a London PM-fix effect. Taken together, the robustness checks are
consistent with the paper’s main interpretation: order-flow informativeness in the XAUUSDT
contract is conditional on the funding state, while session and benchmark-timing patterns
remain suggestive rather than definitive. Earlier diagnostics on HAC lag length, subsamples,
out-of-sample fit, and rolling windows, summarised in Appendix Table A1, point in the same
direction.
8. Discussion
The empirical evidence is most consistent with a positioning-and-reversal mechanism rather
than a classical informed-trading mechanism: in a contract tethered to an external benchmark,
exchange-level order flow conveys information mainly about the state of leveraged
positioning, which the funding mechanism prices, rather than about the fundamental value of
gold, which is set elsewhere.
8.1 Implications for the market design of commodity-linked perpetuals
Read as a whole, the results connect three concrete design parameters of the contract to the
way information enters its price. First, the funding cadence and cap. Because funding is the
channel through which positioning information is priced, the four-hourly settlement
frequency (rather than the eight-hourly cadence of major crypto perpetuals) and the per-
interval cap determine how quickly that information is impounded and how far the perpetual
can drift from its index before the restoring force binds; a faster cadence prices positioning
sooner, which our funding-conditional results suggest is the economically relevant margin.
Second, the off-hours index and mark-price construction. Holding the index fixed and
smoothing the mark price when the underlying gold market is closed mechanically severs
exchange-level flow from fresh benchmark information during those windows, so that
overnight order-flow/return dynamics reflect exchange-internal inventory and liquidity rather
than value discovery — a design choice that directly shapes where on the clock order flow
can and cannot be informative. Third, leverage. Because leverage is what makes the funding
rate a meaningful summary of crowded positioning, the available leverage governs the
strength of the positioning-and-reversal channel we document. In each case a design
parameter maps onto an information-transmission property, which is the sense in which our
findings speak to the market design of this fast-growing contract class rather than to a
tradable signal.


### Page 14

14
The overnight pattern should be read with the contract’s off-hours pricing rules in mind.
Because the index is fixed and the mark price smoothed when the underlying gold market is
closed, overnight order-flow/return dynamics partly reflect exchange-internal inventory and
liquidity rather than the impounding of fresh benchmark information; a purely adverse-
selection reading would over-interpret the data. Finally, we emphasise that none of the
documented effects is exploitable net of trading costs; the contribution is to market structure,
not to alpha.
These patterns carry cautious, and mostly negative, implications for trading. A high reading
of order-flow imbalance is not a buy signal: the quintile evidence shows that high-NOFI
minutes are, if anything, followed by slightly weaker returns, and the sign of any order-flow
effect depends on the funding state rather than on the direction of flow itself. The funding
rate is the more informative state variable — crowded-long conditions warn of reversal in the
wake of buying pressure rather than continuation — but the associated magnitudes are far too
small to overcome trading costs. We therefore read the European-session tendency as, at most,
a weak confirmatory feature within a broader positioning context, and the overnight tendency
as a caution against chasing extreme order flow in thin, off-hours conditions, rather than as
actionable signals.
9. Limitations and Conclusion
We provide the first high-frequency microstructure account of a commodity-linked
cryptocurrency perpetual. Minute-level order flow does not predict returns on its own; its
informativeness is conditional on the funding regime, and the funding rate is the active
channel, while session effects are directionally suggestive but not robust and no effect is
tradable net of costs. The study has clear limitations. The sample covers a single venue, a
single contract, and the instrument’s first months, so the estimates are early-market evidence;
we mitigate, but cannot eliminate, sample-period concerns through the robustness battery. We
do not yet control for external gold-market variables — spot gold, COMEX gold futures, the
dollar index, and scheduled macro announcements — and merging these series is a natural
next step that would sharpen the separation of benchmark-driven from positioning-driven
effects. The cross-asset extension to the companion silver perpetual (XAGUSDT) is also
immediate. These extensions would strengthen the external validity of the results, but the
central finding is already clear: in a benchmark-anchored commodity perpetual, the funding
mechanism is the state variable through which leveraged positioning becomes informative for
short-horizon returns, while raw minute-level order flow is not, on its own, a reliable signal.

Table A1: Robustness battery. The full-sample null and the funding effect are stable across all perturbations; the European and
overnight effects are directionally stable but lose significance under alternative normalisations and non-overlapping sampling.
Multiple-testing correction is reported in Table 6; placebo tests are described in Section 7.
Fix-window event study (identification check). An event study around the London fixes does
not support a fix-driven channel. Around the afternoon (PM) fix, the 15-minute NOFI
coefficient is insignificant in three of four windows and only marginally significant in the [-
30,0] window, where it is negative (β = -0.908, t = -1.77) — the opposite sign to the positive
European-session coefficient — while all four morning-fix windows are insignificant.
Together with the fix-window placebo, in which randomly placed pseudo-fix windows
reproduce the pre-fix coefficient in roughly half of draws, this indicates that the European
pattern is not attributable to the LBMA fix.
Appendix A2. Endogeneity and overlapping-return checks for the funding
interaction
Table A2 reports the NOFI-by-funding interaction coefficient under additional funding lags
and non-overlapping sampling. The negative sign is preserved at all horizons under both one-
and two-period lags; significance is strongest in the baseline (as-of) specification and
attenuates as funding becomes staler. Non-overlapping sampling preserves a significant
negative interaction at the 5-minute horizon.

Figure A2: Distribution and normal Q-Q plot of NOFI (n = 200,807; mean -0.0002, sd 0.513). NOFI is bimodal, with mass at plus
and minus one corresponding to fully one-sided minutes.
Figure A3: Pearson correlation matrix of the main variables. NOFI and OFI are essentially uncorrelated with all forward returns
(absolute r at most 0.02), consistent with the full-sample null, while volume, buy-volume, and sell-volume are highly collinear,
motivating the use of net imbalance rather than separate buy and sell terms. The Spearman matrix is qualitatively identical and
available on request.
The bimodality of NOFI documented in Figure A2 is a feature of low-volume minutes rather
than a construction artifact. Figure A4 splits the sample into volume terciles: the mass at the
boundaries is concentrated in the low-volume tercile (34.0% of those minutes have absolute
NOFI above 0.8), falls to 10.7% at the middle tercile, and to 1.9% in the high-volume tercile,
where the distribution is approximately bell-shaped. Because the main analysis uses the net
imbalance measure and yields a structured null, and the boundary mass is confined to low-
volume minutes that carry little economic weight, the bimodality is a descriptive feature of
the data rather than a driver of the results.

Figure A4: NOFI distribution by volume tercile. The boundary mass at plus and minus one is concentrated in low-volume minutes
(|NOFI| > 0.8 in 34.0% of low-, 10.7% of mid-, and 1.9% of high-volume minutes), confirming that the bimodality is a low-volume
feature rather than a construction artifact.
Finally, Figure A5 plots the 30-day rolling NOFI coefficient with 95% HAC confidence
intervals at the 5- and 15-minute horizons. The coefficient hovers around zero throughout the
sample and is individually significant in only a small minority of windows (about eleven
percent), with the rolling R-squared remaining near zero. This temporal view reinforces the
full-sample structured null: there is no stable window in which raw order flow predicts
returns.
Figure A5: 30-day rolling NOFI coefficient (HAC-robust, 95% CI) at the 5- and 15-minute horizons, with rolling R-squared on the
right axis. Significance appears in roughly eleven percent of windows; the coefficient is otherwise indistinguishable from zero.
