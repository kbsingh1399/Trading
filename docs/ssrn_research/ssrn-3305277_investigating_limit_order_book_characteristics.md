Abstract
With the proliferation of algorithmic high-frequency trading in ﬁnancial markets,
the Limit Order Book has generated increased research interest. Research is still
at an early stage and there is much we do not understand about the dynamics of
Limit Order Books. In this paper, we employ a machine learning approach to
investigate Limit Order Book features and their potential to predict short term price
movements. This is an initial broad-based investigation that results in some novel
observations about LOB dynamics and identiﬁes several promising directions for
further research. Furthermore, we obtain prediction results that are signiﬁcantly
superior to a baseline predictor.

Introduction
High-frequency trading has rapidly become a major force in the ﬁnancial markets and is estimated
to account for 55% of US equity trading volume, 40% of European equity trading volume, and
80% of forex futures volume [Miller and Shorter, 2016]. Changing market dynamics have received
considerable commercial and research interest and increased the focus on market micro-structure,
high-granularity data and speciﬁcally on the Limit Order Book, which is a central element of many
high-frequency trading strategies [Kirilenko et al., 2011], [Smith, 2010] and [Kearns and Nevmyvaka,
2013].In this study we investigate the various features of the LOB in the speciﬁc context of short-term
price prediction. Our scope is restricted to predicting the immediate direction of price movement.
Prediction of the magnitude of price change, or development of a trading strategy based on such
predictions is outside the scope of the current work.
Limit Order Book
Most modern ﬁnancial markets facilitate trade through a double auction mech-
anism centered around a Limit Order Book. Traders submit orders which may be limit orders or
market orders. Limit orders specify a price at which they are to be executed. Market orders on the
other hand are designed to execute at whatever price is available in the market. The LOB serves as a
central record of limit orders waiting to be executed at various price levels. It contains the volume
of orders waiting for execution at each price level on both the buy and sell sides. For example, all
buy limit orders at the highest price are said to occupy the LOB ﬁrst level on the buy-side, all buy
limit orders at the second highest price are said to occupy the LOB second level on the buy side
and so forth. Similarly all sells limit orders at the lowest price are said to occupy the LOB’s ﬁrst
level on the sell-side, all sell limit orders at the second lowest price are said to occupy the LOB’s
second level on the sell side, and so forth. Limit orders at the highest LOB level must be executed
before orders at the next LOB level. Within a given LOB level, orders are generally executed on a
FIFO basis.[Gould and Bonart, 2016]. From this description it should be evident that the LOB holds
much richer multi-dimensional information than price time-series alone, which had been the central
focus of price prediction in the past. With the rise of high-speed electronic trading platforms that

rapidly disseminate extremely granular (nanosecond) trade information, the LOB plays a central role
in modern trading strategies, especially the short time horizon strategies of high-frequency traders.
[Bonart and Gould, 2017].
Approach
We adopt a broad-based approach to study the price predictive potential of the LOB
using machine language methods. The master dataset consists of one day of granular (individual order
level) data on four large cap NASDAQ stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, INTC) totaling approximately
800,000 data points. A baseline predictor is devised that makes predictions based on class frequencies
- this serves as a baseline for further exploration. The issue of unbalanced classes is encountered (price
remains stationary much more frequently than it moves up or down), and several mitigating approaches
are evaluated. Six different classiﬁers are evaluated on the base dataset and the best performed is
tuned as a benchmark for further study. We are able to achieve predictive results signiﬁcantly better
than baseline. We then systematically investigate the price predictive characteristics of subsets of
order and LOB features. In addition to studying the original features of the LOB, we engineer
several features based on other successful studies. Our investigation yields some intuitive as well as
non-intuitive results.
Study Outline
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss the source
and structure of our data, along with system considerations. In Section 3 we describe the basic
optimization of a LOB based price predictor. In section 4 we use our LOB based price predictor to
investigate and engineer LOB features. Section 5 outlines our experimental results. In Section 6 we
conclude our discussion by highlighting major ﬁndings, and identifying areas for future research.

Data and Systems
Data source
Major stock exchanges provide market activity data at different levels of granularity.
Level 1 data generally consists of best bid/ask prices (a.k.a. best bid/ask quotes) along with last
executed price. Level 2 data contains greater detail including information on bid/ask volumes at
various price levels. Exchanges also provide very granular data (at the individual order message level)
as electronic data feeds format. These data are fairly expensive. Furthermore, the order level data
needs to be processed to build a synchronized LOB. Fortunately, the data we required was available
from LobsterData (http://Lobsterdata.com) a data provider offering high-quality limit order book
data of NASDAQ stocks to the academic community. For this study, we restricted ourselves to using
sample data available LobsterData at https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php. Speciﬁcally,
we used the 10-level LOB data for Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft
(MSFT) and Intel (INTC), each consisting of a single day of trading on June 21, 2012.
Data Structure
As discussed above [1], the LOB is a listing of the bid/ask volumes available at
different price levels. Lobster [2] reconstructs the LOB of NASDAQ stocks from granular order level
data. That is, for each order creation, cancellation or execution the LOB is reconstructed. Lobster
sample data is available at Lob depths of 1, 5, 10, 30 and 50 respectively. For our purposes, we
selected LOB-10 data for the selected stocks. For each stock, the data is organized in a "message
ﬁle" and "orderbook ﬁle". The "message ﬁle" contains all order events that affect (in our case) a
10-level LOB. Stated differently, the "message ﬁle" contains all order creations, changes, executions
and cancellations and deletions that occur at one of the top 10 price levels (on both buy and sell side).
The "orderbook ﬁle" corresponds row-for-row with the "message ﬁle" and provides a reconstructed
10-level Lob for each relevant order event included in the "message ﬁle". A schematic of the Lobster
ﬁle structures is provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Computational Considerations
Study experiments were conducted on an Acer notebook with a
1.83 GHz Intel Celeron processor, 8 Gb RAM operating Windows 8.1 (64 bit) operating system,
using Python 3.14 with Spyder IDE. The message and orderbook ﬁles for each of the selected stocks
range in size from 156,000 to 250,000 lines of data. Due to the volume of data (even for a single
day of trading) and computing power limitations, it was not feasible to conduct multiple iterations of
the various experiments on the entire dataset. We generally chose to conduct experiments on sample
sizes ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 data points. We also conducted the entire series of experiment on
the entire dataset for one stock (the program completed in 72 hours). Each time a smaller sample was
used to conduct an experiment, we performed a "sanity check" against the results of the corresponding

Designing a LOB based Price Predictor
In the ﬁrst half of the study, a LOB based price predictor is developed. First price prediction is deﬁned
more speciﬁcally. Then a baseline predictor "BasePred" is devised which classiﬁes based on label
frequency in the test set. BasePred is run against the base dataset to establish performance baseline.
Six classiﬁers are evaluated on the base dataset. A signiﬁcant class imbalances issue is encountered
and we investigate binarization, over/under-sampling and smoothing approaches to counter the issue.
The most promising classiﬁer is selected for parameter tuning and further study.
Deﬁning Price Prediction
In the context of limit orders "sitting in the LOB" at various prices,
and order executions occurring at speciﬁc prices, the concept of price needs to be deﬁned more
speciﬁcally. One option is to deﬁne price as the last execution price (i.e. last price at which a
trade occurred). However, trades occurs much less frequently than order creations, changes and
cancellations and much order and LOB activity takes place in between order executions as is evident
Figure 2. Therefore another option is to deﬁne price as the mid-point between the best ask and bid
price (also known as the "mid-quote price"). We take latter approach in this study. We initially deﬁne
price prediction as predicting whether (mid-quote) price at the next order event is less than, greater
than or equal to the current mid-quote price. Thus at a given time t (i.e. for a given data point), and
mid-quote price at that time pt, the class label Ct is deﬁned as follows:
Class Label, Ct =



−1,
if p(t+1) > pt
1,
if p(t+1) < pt
0,
otherwise
(1)
Metrics
The main metrics used to evaluate prediction results are accuracy, precision and recall.
Since class imbalance issues are anticipated, we shall also calculate class speciﬁc accuracy rates.
Finally, we shall calculate two versions of the F1 score. F1-weighted provides an F1 score weighted
by class frequency and therefore favours the majority class. F1-Micro provides an F1-score as as
an unweighted mean of the the class speciﬁc F1-scores, treating each class equally. We anticipate a
majority C=0 class, and minority C=+1 or -1 classes, but the direction of price change is important,
therefore, we shall pay close attention to the F1-Micro score.

Baseline Predictor
While different classiﬁers have attained varying levels of predictive success
in studies [Gould and Bonart, 2016], [Tsantekidis et al., 2017], [Zheng et al., 2012], [Kercheval
and Zhang, 2015] and [Kearns and Nevmyvaka, 2013], there is no clear cut winner. Further, the
implementations of classiﬁers and datasets used in these studies were not available to us. We therefore,
deﬁned our own basic baseline predictor "BasePred" which predicts class labels randomly with a
probability equal to the frequency with which each class appears in the dataset. More speciﬁcally,
BasePred makes random predictions based on class probabilities P( ˆC = k), as follows:
P( ˆC = k) = Nc=k
N
(2)
where Nc=k is the number of labels of Class k, N is the total number of labels, and k is in { 0,1,-1}.
BasePred achieved high overall accuracy on the Base dataset, however the accuracy for predicting
individual classes displayed high variance as described in Table 1. Furthermore, F1-weighted and
F1-micro scores varied widely also pointing to a class imbalance issue (discussed in detail below).
For comparison purposes a Noise Dataset was generated with random values for all features, and
class labels derived from these random values. BasePred performed comparatively on Base and Noise
datasets (Table 1) therefore providing a good baseline to ensure evaluated classiﬁers do not "cheat"
by merely modeling class frequencies. .

Classiﬁer Evaluation
The following classiﬁers were selected for evaluation: Guassian Naive Bayes
(GNB), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (NNet), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Classiﬁer (GPC) and Random Forest (RF). Standard
classiﬁer implementations from the SKlearn library were used. SVM and GPC did not achieve
convergence in a reasonable time even for small data samples - therefore these classiﬁers were
eliminated at an early stage. SGD, which models logistic classiﬁcation or support vector machines
under a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, also displayed erratic results. Positive results from
RF encouraged us to include ensemble classiﬁers Adaboost (ADA) and Gradient Boosting Classiﬁer
(GDB). Six classiﬁers were run against the Base dataset, providing the results in Table 2. All
classiﬁers (except SGD) achieved strong overall accuracy, weak class-speciﬁc accuracy especially
for +1 and -1 classes, and a high variance between F1-weighted and F1-micro scores, reﬂecting the
unbalanced class problem. Furthermore, none performed especially stronger than BasePred, but RF
displayed some promise.

Unbalanced Classes
The initial deﬁnition of price prediction (Equation 1) resulted in approxi-
mately 90% of data points belonging to the ’0’ class, with classes ’+1’ and ’-1’ balanced at approxi-
mately 5% each. In other words, from one order event to the next, price remained constant much

more frequently than it changed because the majority of order events do not impact the LOB ﬁrst
level. The classiﬁers (including BasePred) displayed a high overall accuracy and F1-Weighted score
but performed not much better than BasePred on F1-Micro and Accuracy of predicting ’+1’ and ’-1’.
The Classiﬁers were modeling the over-frequency of the ’0’ class. To further investigate the issue, a
Binarized dataset was generated by removing all ’0’ class data-points. The six classiﬁers were run
against the more balanced Binarized dataset resulting in consistent accuracy across classes, reduction
in gap between F1-Weighted and F1-Micro , and overall superior performance to BasePred across all
classiﬁers ( 3). The ensemble classiﬁers displayed the strongest performance, with RF in a slight lead.
The Binarized Dataset captures the direction of price movement when price changes but ignores all
points in time where price remains stationary, and as such is not applicable to our problem. The
synthetic minority over-sampling technique ("SMOTE") is an academically accepted method to
address class imbalance issues [Chawla et al., 2002]. The SKlearn Imblearn implementation of
SMOTE was used to create an over-sampled (on minority class) and under-sampled (on majority
class) version of the Base dataset called the SMOTE dataset. The results of running the six classiﬁers
on the SMOTE dataset are shown in Table 4. SGD and NNet predicted all data as ’+1’ or ’-1’
respectively, for reasons not understood and not explored further. GNB continued to have divergent
(and not much better than baseline) accuracy across classes. Ensemble classiﬁers demonstrated
stronger overall accuracy, F1-weighted and F1-micro scores compared to BasePred, yet continued to
have trouble predicting ’+1’ and ’-1’. The reason for this disparity is discussed in the Smoothing
section below.

Smoothing
Over/under-sampling improved results for all classiﬁers, but did not address the root
cause of the unbalanced classes due to deﬁning price prediction in terms of price at next time-step.
Price moves in a discontinuous and abrupt manner at each time-step, and even if there is a short term
trend in a speciﬁc direction, individual arriving orders may move price in either direction, or not
move price at all. The classiﬁers are better at predicting whether price changes or not (i.e. ’0’ class
accuracy) because this is the over-whelming majority case, but are not as good at predicting price
change direction (i.e. ’+1’ and ’-1’ class accuracy). A way to address the abrupt discontinuous nature
of price at each time step is to utilize a smoothing approach similar to Tsantekidis et al. [2017]. First,
the mean of the previous S prices, denoted by mprev and the mean of the next S prices, denoted by
mnext is calculated as follows:

mprev = 1
S

i=o
pt−i
(3)
mnext = 1
S

pt+i
(4)
where pt is the mid-quote price at time t. Then the new smoothed class label ˜Ct expresses the
direction of price movement at time t by comparing the previously calculated quantities mprev and
mnext as follows:
Smoothed Class Label, ˜Ct =



−1,
if mb(t) > ma(t) · (1 + α ∆pmin)
+1,
if mb(t) < ma(t) · (1 + α ∆pmin)
0,
otherwise
(5)
where ∆pmin is the day’s minimum price change, and α is a smoothing parameter that deﬁnes the
least amount price needs to change to be considered as an upward or downward price trend. The six
classiﬁers were run against the new smoothed label dataset assuming S = 10 and α = 1 (Table 5).
Smoothing results in a narrowed gap between class-speciﬁc accuracy (except in SGD and NNet which
respectively fail to predict ’0’ and ’1’ completely for reasons not explored further). The ensemble
classiﬁers show markedly superior performance to BasePred, with RF taking a clear lead.
In the smoothing algorithm the α parameter deﬁnes how sensitive our algorithm is to price changes,
and the S parameter deﬁnes the short-term horizon of backward and forward prices to be considered.
These parameters are optimized in the next section after selection of the winning classiﬁer.

Predictor Selection and Tuning
RF was a clear winner with the smoothed dataset, and though
GDB demonstrated promising results, its runs time was considerably (10X) longer than RF. Therefore,
we selected RF as our predictor for the remaining part of the study. We tuned RF using standard
K-Fold Validation within the Sklearn GridSearchCV function on the following parameters: number
of estimators, maximum features considered and minimum samples per tree leaf. the smoothing
algorithms two hyper parameters α and S were also tuned by running RF on a combined range of
values. Results of smoothing parameter tuning are listed in Table 6. Parameters α = 1 and S=20 were
non-rigorously selected as optimal parameters. This smoothing parametrization produced labels in
frequency ratio 0 : +1 : −1 = 47 : 23 : 30 and produced the best overall and class-speciﬁc accuracy.
However, prediction of the ’0’ class was problematic (<50%) across the entire parameter range
studied. Due to time constraints, we proceeded with the selected parameters for smoothing. Once
tuning was complete, we ran RF against the Smoothed dataset Table ( 7) to establish a benchmark for
the next part of the study.

approach similar to Kercheval and Zhang [2015] is employed where related features are divided into
feature sets to gauge relative prediction informativeness.
Order Features
The features in the Lobster message ﬁle (Figure 1) were divided into Order Feature
Sets as deﬁned in Table 8. The results of running the RF Predictor on Order Feature Sets are listed in
Table 9. The Order-Time feature set (consisting of a single feature - time in seconds from mid-night)
stands out anomalously with high overall and class-speciﬁc accuracy and F1 scores. We believe
this may be occurring because we are using a single day of trading data, and the predictor may
be over-ﬁtting on the time feature. However, further investigation is required to understand the
anomalous behaviour. Surprisingly, Order-ID is a useful feature presumably due to its relationship to
Time. Not surprisingly, Order-Direction and Order-Type on their own provide very little information.
However, Order-Details (which includes (Size, Price and Direction) is also weakly predictive, perhaps
signifying that order information without LOB information is not very informative.
LOB Features
The features in the Lobster orderbook ﬁle (Figure 1) were divided into LOB Feature
sets based on different LOB depths as illustrated in Table 10. The results of running the RF Predictor
on LOB Feature Sets are listed in Table 11. As expected, the LOB is strongly predictive. Performance
deteriorated at an increasing rate as less LOB levels were used in a Feature Set, with the largest
performance drop occurring between LOB-2 and LOB-1, as illustrated in Figure 4.
Imbalance Features
In recent years, several studies [Cartea et al., 2015], [Yang and Zhu, 2016],
[Gould and Bonart, 2016] have proposed that LOB imbalance is a simple and effective feature for
price prediction. The latter study deﬁned LOB imbalance, IL,t, at each LOB price level L and each
time-step t as follows:
IL,t = V buy
L
−V sell
L
V buy
L
+ V sell
L

and V sell

are the volume of buy and sell orders, respectively at each LOB level L. Using
this deﬁnition, LOB imbalance at each of the 10 LOB levels was calculated for the entire dataset,
and Imbalance Feature sets were generated as illustrated in Table 12. The results of running the
RF Predictor on the Imbalance Feature Sets are listed in Table 13. LOB imbalance features are
shown to have predictive value comparable to the LOB itself. Furthermore, while LOB features
deteriorate in predictive power as the number of levels is decreased, LOB imbalance features improve
in predictive power as the number of levels is decreased. Finally, the smallest Imbalance Feature Set
(IMB-1) is shown to have stronger predictive power than the largest LOB Feature Set (LOB-10). The
relationship between Imbalance Level and Accuracy is illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4: Accuracy vs LOB Imbalance
Order Arrival Rates
The "Order Arrival Rate" was designed as a novel engineered feature, inspired
by the success of the order intensity concept in Kercheval and Zhang [2015]. The Order Arrival
Rates features capture the volume of buy and sell orders created, canceled and executed within a
short historic window ∆thist, and also distinguish between orders at LOB level 1 vs all other orders.
The Order Arrival Feature Sets are deﬁned in Table 14. The results of running the RF Predictor on
Arrival Rate Feature Sets for ∆thist of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 seconds are listed in Table 15. Arrival Rates
demonstrated some predictive potential. The Arrival Rates of orders at LOB level 1 (Feature Set
Arrt-LOBOrds) generally provided better information than the Arrival Rates of other orders (Feature
Set Arrt-Ords), except in the peculiar case of ∆thist = 1.0sec. This engineered feature has the
potential to outperform non-engineered order features (Table 9) but the ∆thist parameter must be
optimized.
Combining Features
The best Feature Sets from each category (Orders, LOB, Imbalances, Arrival
Rates) were aggregated into a Combined dataset. The results of running the RF Predictor on the
Combined dataset are listed in Table 16. However no signiﬁcant improvement was seen compared
to the benchmark of running RF on the Base dataset. Further study is needed to attempt to improve
predictive results via feature engineering and feature set optimization.

Conclusion
In this study, we attempted to develop a LOB based price predictor. Several classiﬁers were evaluated.
Class imbalance in our dataset was addressed relatively effectively via smoothing. Random Forest was
determined to be the optimal classiﬁer (from amongst those tested), and after classiﬁer and smoothing
parameter tuning, we achieved signiﬁcantly superior prediction results to a baseline (class frequency
based) predictor (Table 7). Our predictor was used to evaluate several feature sets containing various
order and LOB features.
There are several ways in which this study could be improved and several avenues for further
exploration. A larger data set including multiple weeks or months and multiple stocks should be
incorporated in the analysis. Classiﬁers which behaved erratically in this study (SGD and NNet)
should be looked at further as these have demonstrated positive results in other studies. Classiﬁers
which proved too computationally intensive (GPC, GDB and SVM-nonSGD) should also be looked
at to see if tuning can make these classiﬁers workable. The phenomenon of achieving low accuracy
on ’0’ predictions after smoothing warrants further investigation. The anomalously high prediction
accuracy obtainable using the Time feature alone needs to be understood further 4. LOB Features’
predictive power deteriorated as less LOB levels were incorporated, however the opposite was true for
LOB imbalance features - this phenomenon warrants further investigation. Order Arrival Rates is an
engineered feature that demonstrates potential. LOB change rates (the short term historic change in
LOB) could be another engineered feature worth studying. Finally, the optimization of LOB feature
sets and development of engineered features with strong predictive potential could be avenues of
future research.
